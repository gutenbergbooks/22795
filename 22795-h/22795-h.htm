<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>After communication with many of the teachers who have been
using the Principles and Practice of Oral Reading in their classes,
the author has made a number of important additions and changes. In
its amended form the book is published under the title of the
"Ontario High School Reader."</p>

<p>As the book is intended for the teaching of oral reading it
contains an introductory chapter on the Principles of Reading, and
selections for practice, with appended notes. An effort has also
been made to grade the selections in the order of their difficulty.
Accordingly, a number of selections, each illustrating in a marked
degree only one, or at most two, of the various elements of Vocal
Expression, have been placed at the beginning; these should, of
course, be taught before the more complex selections are
attempted.</p>

<p>It is not intended that the pupil shall master the chapter on
the principles before beginning to read the selections; he should
become familiar with each topic as it is illustrated in the lesson.
In dealing with each lesson the teacher should first ascertain the
elements of vocal expression that it best exemplifies. He should
then discuss these elements with the pupils, using the necessary
paragraphs of the Introduction, and such black-board exercises as
he may deem necessary, until he is satisfied that the pupils are
ready to undertake the study of the selection. At the oral reading
the pupils should be able to show their mastery of the principles
thus taught. Toward the close of the course, they will naturally
read connectedly the various sections of the Introduction, in order
to obtain a comprehensive and systematic view of the
principles.</p>

<p>To secure good reading, systematic drill on the exercises in
Vowel Sounds and in Articulation is also necessary.</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLES OF READING</h3>

<div class="center_bold">Importance of Oral Reading</div>

<p>There are several reasons why every boy or girl should strive to
become a good reader. In the first place, good oral reading is an
accomplishment in itself. It affords a great deal of pleasure to
others as well as to ourselves. In the second place, it improves
our everyday speech and is also a preparation for public speaking;
for the one who reads with distinctness and an accent of refinement
is likely to speak in the same way, whether in private conversation
or on the public platform. Moreover, it is only one step from
reading aloud before the class to recitation, and another step from
recitation to public speaking. Lastly, oral reading is the best
method of bringing out and conveying to others and to oneself all
that a piece of literature expresses. For example, the voice is
needed to bring out the musical effects of poetry. The following
lines will illustrate this point:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">But the sea-caves rung, and
the wild winds sung</span> <span class="i0">The dirge of lovely
Rosabelle.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Here the music of the rhythm and the harmony between sound and
sense would be almost entirely lost in silent reading.</p>

<p>The voice, too, is often the surest and most effective means of
conveying differences of meaning and feeling in both prose and
poetry. The following words from <i>Herv&eacute; Riel</i> (pp. <a
href="#Page_241">241</a>-247) may be made to convey different
meanings according to the intonation of the voice:</p>

<div class="poem3">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Burn the fleet and ruin
France?</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg
2]</a></span></p>

<p>This may be read to express hesitation and deliberation, or, as
is the evident intention, shewn by the context as well as by the
punctuation, to express Herv&eacute; Riel's surprise and
indignation that such a thought should be entertained.<br />
<br />
</p>

<div class="center_bold">Mechanical Side of Oral Reading</div>

<p>Now in what does oral reading consist? It consists, first of
all, in recognizing the words, pronouncing them correctly, and
articulating them distinctly. The pupil in the First Book, who is
learning to read, is trying to master this side of reading, which
is the mechanical side. He cannot be too careful as to the habits
of speech he forms; for correct position of the organs of speech
and proper control of the breath make for correct pronunciation and
distinct articulation, which are two of the foundation stones of
good reading.</p>

<p><b>By correct pronunciation</b>, we mean the pronunciation
approved by a standard dictionary. Elegance and refinement of
speech depend largely on the correct pronunciation of the vowel
sounds. The vowel <i>a</i>, which is sounded in seven different
ways in the English language, presents the greatest difficulty.
Many people recognize at most, only the sound of a in <i>at</i>,
<i>ate</i>, <i>all</i>, <i>far</i>, and <i>mortal</i> respectively.
They ignore the sound as in <i>air</i>, and the shorter quantity of
the Italian <i>a</i> in <i>ask</i>, giving the sound of a in
<i>ate</i> to the former and of <i>a</i> in <i>at</i> or <i>a</i>
in <i>all</i> or <i>a</i> in <i>far</i> to the latter. Another
difficulty is that of distinguishing the sound of <i>oo</i> in
<i>roof, food</i>, etc., from the sound of <i>oo</i> in <i>book</i>
and <i>good</i>, and from the sound of <i>u</i> in such words as
<i>pure</i> and <i>duke</i>.</p>

<p>Pronunciation, when perfectly pure, should be free from what we
call provincialisms; that is, from any peculiarity of tone, accent,
or vowel sound, which would mark the speaker as coming from any
particular locality. If our pronunciation is perfectly pure, it
does not indicate, in the slightest degree, the part of the country
in which we have lived.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg
3]</a></span><b>Distinct articulation</b> requires that each
syllable should receive its full value, and that the end of a word
should be enunciated as distinctly as the beginning. It depends
largely on the way in which we utter the consonants, just as
correct pronunciation depends on the enunciation of the vowels.
Final consonants are easily slurred, especially in the case of
words ending in two or more consonants, which present special
difficulties of articulation. Such words are <i>mends</i>,
<i>seethes</i>, <i>thirsteth</i>, <i>breathed</i>, etc. Sometimes,
too, the careless reader fails to articulate two consonants
separately when the first word ends with the consonant or consonant
sound with which the second begins; for example, <i>Sir Richard
Grenville lay</i>, <i>Spanish ships</i>; or when the first word
ends with a consonant and the second begins with a vowel, as in
<i>eats apples</i>, <i>not at all</i>, <i>an ox</i>, etc. On the
other hand, too evident an effort to secure the proper enunciation
of the sound elements should be avoided, since a stilted mode of
utterance is thus produced.</p>

<p>Exercises for drill in the vowel sounds and in articulation are
provided in Appendix <a href="#Page_306">A</a>.<br />
<br />
</p>

<div class="center_bold">Expression</div>

<p>Oral reading, however, even in its earliest stages, consists in
more than recognizing words, pronouncing them correctly, and
articulating them distinctly. It includes thinking thoughts, seeing
mental pictures, (which is only another form of thinking) and
feeling varied emotions&mdash;all while the mechanical act of
reading is going on. To illustrate, let us take a line from <i>The
Island of the Scots</i>:</p>

<div class="poem0">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">High flew the spray above
their heads, yet onward still they bore.</span></div>
</div>

<p>If we wish to read this line well, what must we do besides
pronouncing the words correctly and articulating them distinctly?
We must think about the meaning of what we read. <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>This
includes two kinds of thinking. In the example we first think the
picture presented by the words; that is, we make a mental image of
the little band of Scots, hand in hand, trying to ford the swiftly
flowing waters of the swollen river. This is called <b>concrete
thinking</b>. At the same time we form some judgment based on the
picture. We think of the great determination and courage these men
showed in struggling forward in spite of the danger. This is called
<b>abstract thinking</b>. But, as we have said, a reader does more
than think in these two ways&mdash;he feels; and feeling, or
<b>emotion</b>, comes of itself, if the reader thinks in the two
ways described, for emotion is the result of thinking. Especially
is it the result of concrete thinking; for what we see, even if
only with the mind's eye, stirs our emotions more than that of
which we think in the abstract.</p>

<p>While reading the line just quoted, there are three emotions
which spring from the thinking. As we see these men struggling
against the strong current we have an emotion of fear for them;
then as we think of their determination and courage in the face of
such great danger, an emotion of determination comes to us, for we
identify ourselves with their fortunes; and lastly we are filled
with admiration for their heroism. Thus we experience the three
emotions of fear, determination, and admiration, while performing
the mechanical act of reading the words. These emotions, together
with the two kinds of thinking mentioned, affect the voice and the
manner of reading, and determine what we call <b>expression</b>. If
the words were simply repeated mechanically there would be no
expression. Since expression involves the employment of so many
different powers at one time, a mastery of the art of expression is
much harder to acquire, than a mastery of merely the mechanical
side of reading.</p>

<p>Accordingly, good vocal expression springs primarily from
something within ourselves&mdash;that is, from our mental and
emotional state. It cannot be acquired by mechanical imitation,
whether of the reading of another, or of the movements, sounds, and
gestures indicated in the subject <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>matter of what we read.
Nevertheless it is very stimulating to hear a selection well read,
not because a model is thus supplied for our imitation, but because
we get a grasp of the selection as a whole, and because the voice,
which possesses great power in stirring the imagination and the
feelings, thus prepares within us the mental and emotional state
necessary for the correct expression.</p>

<p>In the same way, imitation of the movements, sounds, and
gestures, suggested by the subject matter may be a stimulus to
thought and feeling when preparing a selection, since what we have
actually reproduced is more real to us than what we have only
imagined. After such preparation, imitation, if it enters into the
reading at all, will be spontaneous, and not intentional and
forced. In reading <i>The Charge of the Light Brigade</i> or <i>The
Ride from Ghent to Aix</i>, we do not designedly hurry along to
imitate rapidity of movement; but, rather, the imagination having
been kindled by the picture, our pulse is quickened, and the voice
moves rapidly in sympathy with the feelings aroused.</p>

<p>In the following extract (p. <a href="#Page_216">216</a>) the
atmosphere is one of joy. The reader is moved through sympathy with
Horatius, and his voice indicates the joy of the Romans, but he
does not attempt to imitate vocally, or by gesture, the "shouts,"
"clapping," and "weeping":</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">Now round him throng the
Fathers</span> <span class="i1">To press his gory hands;</span>
<span class="i1">And now, with shouts and clapping,</span> <span
class="i1">He enters through the River-Gate,</span> <span class=
"i1">Borne by the joyous crowd.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, as already stated, we imitate spontaneously:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">Back darted Spurius
Lartius;</span> <span class="i1">Herminius darted back:</span>
<span class="i1">And, as they passed, beneath their feet</span>
<span class="i1">They felt the timbers crack.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg
6]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we imitate spontaneously the movement expressive of sudden
fear. Our action is prompted by our own fears for their safety.</p>

<p>Sometimes the feeling is still more complex. In reading the
following we spontaneously reproduce Sextus' alternate hate and
fear which, moreover, we tinge with our own contempt:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">Thrice looked he at the
city;</span> <span class="i1">Thrice looked he at the dead;</span>
<span class="i1">And thrice came on in fury,</span> <span class=
"i1">And thrice turned back in dread:</span> <span class="i1">And,
white with fear and hatred,</span> <span class="i1">Scowled at the
narrow way</span> <span class="i1">Where, wallowing in a pool of
blood,</span> <span class="i1">The bravest Tuscans
lay.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In reading the little poem from <i>The Princess</i>, (page <a
href="#Page_107">107</a>) note how we are influenced by the tense
emotion of the attendants who speak. We do not try to imitate them;
but having made the scene stand out before us, we speak as we in
imagination hear them, in an aspirated tone of voice:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">She must weep or she will
die.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the last line it would savour of melodrama to try to
impersonate the lady as she says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">Sweet my child, I live for
thee.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The important point is to show intelligent sympathy with her
speech, not to imitate her manner of uttering it.</p>

<p>On the other hand we must not make the mistake of supposing that
if we get the thought and the emotion, the true vocal expression
will follow. One who has a fine appreciation of a piece of
literature may, notwithstanding, read it very indifferently. Even
in conversation where we are interpreting vocally our own thoughts
and feelings, we sometimes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7"
id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>misplace emphasis or employ the wrong
inflection. How much more likely we are to fall into such errors
when we attempt to interpret vocally from a book the thoughts of
another.</p>

<div class="center_bold">Elements of Vocal Expression</div>

<p>In order to criticise ourselves or understand intelligent
criticism, we must have a knowledge of the laws that govern
speech&mdash;that is, we must know what properties of tone or what
acts of the voice correspond to certain mental and emotional
states. For example, the amount and character of thinking done
while we read determines the rate of utterance; the purpose or
motive of the thought and its completeness or incompleteness are
indicated by an upward or downward slide of the voice; the nervous
tension expresses itself in a certain key; the physical and mental
energy, in a certain power or volume of the voice; and the
character of the emotion is reflected in the quality. These
principles of vocal expression are known technically as the
elements of <b>time</b>, <b>inflection</b>, <b>pitch</b>,
<b>force</b>, and <b>quality</b>. Closely connected with these
elements are <b>pause</b>, <b>grouping</b>, <b>stress</b>,
<b>emphasis</b>, <b>shading</b>, and <b>perspective</b>.</p>

<p><b>Pause.</b> It must be quite clear that when we are reading
silently, for the purpose of getting the thought for ourselves, our
minds are at work as has been described. We shall now examine how
this work done by the mind affects the voice and produces what we
call good expression when we are reading aloud for the purpose of
conveying thought to others. As an illustration we shall take an
example from <i>The Glove and the Lions</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">The nobles fill'd the benches
round, the ladies by their side,</span> <span class="i0">And
'mongst them Count de Lorge, with one he hoped to make his
bride.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In these lines there are certain words or phrases which stand
out prominently, since they call up mental pictures, namely:
"nobles," "benches round," "Count de Lorge," and <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>"one." In
order to give time to make these mental pictures, we naturally
pause after each one. At the end of the first line we combine the
details, making a larger mental image, with the result that we make
a long pause after "side." In reading the second line, the eye and
the mind run ahead of the voice, and the reader, wishing to impress
the listener with the new and important idea "Count de Lorge,"
pauses before it as well as after it. In the same way he pauses
before the phrase, "he hoped to make his bride," to prepare the
mind of the listener to receive the impression. Thus we see that,
if the mind is working, a pause occurs after a word while we are
making a mental image or trying to realize the idea more fully, and
also often before we express an important idea, in order to prepare
the mind of the listener for what is to come.</p>

<p>A very useful exercise in the study of pause is to image the
pictures in selections such as the following:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Come from deep glen (picture)
and</span> <span class="i1">From mountain so rocky;
(picture)</span> <span class="i0">The war pipe and pennon
(picture)</span> <span class="i1">Are at Inverlocky.</span> <span
class="i0">Come every hill-plaid, and</span> <span class="i1">True
heart that wears one; (picture)</span> <span class="i0">Come every
steel blade, (picture) and</span> <span class="i1">Strong hand that
bears one. (picture)</span><br />
<span class="i0">Leave untended the herd, (picture)</span> <span
class="i1">The flock without shelter; (picture)</span> <span class=
"i0">Leave the corpse uninterred, (picture)</span> <span class=
"i1">The bride at the altar; (picture)</span> <span class=
"i0">Leave the deer, (picture) leave the steer, (picture)</span>
<span class="i1">Leave nets and barges: (picture)</span> <span
class="i0">Come with your fighting gear,</span> <span class=
"i1">Broadswords and targes, (picture)</span></div>
</div>

<p>Then, too, in passing from one idea or thought to another, the
mind requires time to make the transition:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Stout Lartius hurled down
Aunus</span> <span class="i1">Into the stream beneath:</span> <span
class="i0"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg
9]</a></span>Herminius struck at Seius,</span> <span class="i1">And
clove him to the teeth:</span> <span class="i0">At Picus brave
Horatius</span> <span class="i1">Darted one fiery thrust;</span>
<span class="i0">And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms</span> <span
class="i1">Clashed in the bloody dust.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Here the mind passes in succession from the action of Lartius to
that of Herminius and that of Horatius. A long pause is required
after "beneath," "teeth," and "dust," with a shorter pause after
"Seius" and after "thrust." Further, if the thoughts concern
actions far apart, more time is required to make the transition,
and hence a longer pause:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">All day long that free flag
toss'd</span> <span class="i1">Over the heads of the rebel
host.</span><br />
<span class="i1">Ever its torn folds rose and fell</span> <span
class="i1">On the loyal winds that loved it well;</span><br />
<span class="i1">And through the hill-gaps, sunset light</span>
<span class="i1">Shone over it with a warm good-night.</span><br />
<span class="i1">Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er,</span> <span
class="i1">And the Rebel rides on his raids no more.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Note the transition in thought from the day on which these
stirring events are supposed to have taken place to the present
time. This is indicated by a long pause after "warm
good-night."</p>

<p>Sometimes the mind requires time to fill in ideas suggested but
not expressed:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">Forty flags with their crimson
bars,</span> <span class="i1">Flapped in the morning wind: the
sun</span> <span class="i1">Of noon look'd down and saw not
one.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Here, the tearing down of the flags between the morning and
noon, is suggested to the mind; hence a long pause after
"wind."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg
10]</a></span></p>

<p>Where an ellipsis occurs and the meaning is not obvious, there
is a pause to give time to realize the logical connection:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">I'd rather rove with Edmund
there</span> <span class="i1">Than reign our English
queen.</span><br />
<span class="i1">Here's the English can and will!</span></div>
</div>

<p>Note the pauses after "reign," and "English" (second
example).</p>

<p>In such examples as the following where the meaning is obvious,
the pauses after "them," "one," "weary," and "wounded," make
prominent the important idea following:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">And 'mongst them Count de
Lorge, with one he hoped to make his bride.</span><br />
<span class="i1">The weary to sleep and the wounded to
die.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When preparing to read a selection, it is of great importance to
make the leading thoughts stand out clearly in the mind so that we
may be able to present them one by one. The poem <i>Barbara
Frietchie</i> (p. <a href="#Page_113">113.</a>) could be divided
into paragraphs with some such titles as the following: (1) the
town of Frederick and its surroundings, (2) the approach of the
army, (3) the tearing down of the flags, (4) the raising of Barbara
Frietchie's flag, (5) Stonewall Jackson and his men, and so on.
Each of the paragraphs is a complete section of the poem, and
requires a well-marked pause before passing on to the next one.</p>

<p><b>Grouping.</b> In the extract from <i>The Glove and the
Lions</i>, used above to illustrate pause, the mental pictures and
important ideas are suggested in nearly every ease by a single
word. Ideas are, however, suggested as often by groups of words as
by single words. These groups are treated as single words, and may
take pauses before or after them as the case may be. The reader,
who is thinking as he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id=
"Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>reads, will group together words that
express one idea, or symbolize one picture, presenting these ideas
and pictures to himself and to the listener one by one, and
separating by a pause, of greater or less length, those not closely
connected.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>A slouched leather cap|| half hid his face| bronzed by the sun
and wind| and dripping with sweat.|| He wore a cravat twisted like
a rope|| coarse blue trousers| worn and shabby| white on one knee|
and with holes in the other;|| an old ragged gray blouse| patched
on one side with a piece of green cloth| sewed with twine;|| upon
his back| was a well-filled knapsack,|| in his hand| he carried an
enormous knotted stick;|| his stockingless feet| were in hobnailed
shoes;|| his hair was cropped|| and his beard long.</p>
</div>

<p>Here the double vertical lines mark off groups of words which
express one idea or symbolize one picture, and which are therefore
each separated from the other by a well-marked pause. The single
vertical lines indicate a shorter pause between the subdivisions of
each group. The phrase "an old ragged gray blouse patched on one
side with a piece of green cloth sewed with twine" presents one
picture by itself, and is separated from the context by a long
pause, but each detail in this picture is presented in turn to the
mind's eye, hence the shorter pauses after "blouse," "cloth," and
"twine."</p>

<p>The reader should be careful not to allow pause and grouping to
produce a jerky effect, thus interfering with the rhythm. This
applies especially to poetry, which demands, in order to preserve
the rhythm, that the caesural pause should not be slighted, and
that there should be a more or less marked pause at the end of each
line:</p>

<p class="two">And they had trod the Pass once more, and stoop'd on
either side</p>

<p class="two">To pluck the heather from the spot where he had
dropped and died.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg
12]</a></span> In the second line, the caesural pause occurs after
"spot," but the phrase "from the spot where he had dropped and
died" expresses one idea and must be given as a whole. The rhythm
and the grouping appear to be at variance; but the difficulty is
easily overcome by making the caesural pause shorter than the pause
after "heather" which introduces the group, and at the same time,
by not allowing the voice to fall on the word "spot."</p>

<p>The following affords another instance where the grouping
appears to interfere with the rhythm:</p>

<div class="poem3">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">If the husband of this gifted
well</span> <span class="i0">Shall drink before his wife,</span>
<span class="i0">A happy man thenceforth is he,</span> <span class=
"i0">For he shall be master for life.</span></div>
</div>

<p>"Of this gifted well" is evidently not connected in thought with
"husband." It must be separated from "husband" by a pause and
attached to "shall drink" at the beginning of the next line. To do
this, it is not, however, necessary to omit the pause at the end of
the line; for this would mar the effect of the rhythm. The
difficulty is again overcome by making the pause at the end of the
line shorter than the pauses which mark the grouping, and by not
allowing the voice to fall on "well."</p>

<p><b>Time</b> is the rate at which we read. It is fast or slow
according to the number and the length of the pauses between words
and phrases, and also according to the length of time the reader
dwells on the words themselves. There is perhaps no more frequent
criticism made on reading than that it is too fast. What does this
mean? It means that the reader is not doing enough thinking as he
repeats the words. Consequently, he does not dwell on words that
are full of meaning, nor pause before and after words and phrases
to make the mental picture and to grasp the thought more fully.
Moreover, for the benefit of the listener, the reading should be
slower than is required by the reader for himself. The <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>reader,
with his eye on the page, can allow his eye and mind to run ahead
of his voice, and can thus realize the thought in less time than
the listener. The following line calls for a comparatively small
amount of thinking:</p>

<p class="two">High flew the spray above their heads, yet onward
still they bore.</p>

<p>Here, there is little except what is on the surface, and the
thoughts suggested by the words are of the kind to make the mind
think rapidly. Hence the line is read in faster time than the
average rate. Reading may, accordingly, be fast from one or both of
two causes. First, when there is no background of thought for the
mind to dwell upon, and second when the nature of the thoughts
themselves, such as the narration of the rapid succession of
events, impels to quick mental action. The following lines from
<i>Pibroch of Donuil Dhu</i> (p. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>) will
serve as an illustration:</p>

<div class="poem3">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Faster come, faster
come,</span> <span class="i1">Faster and faster,</span> <span
class="i0">Chief, vassal, page and groom,</span> <span class=
"i1">Tenant and master.</span> <span class="i0">Fast they come,
fast they come;</span> <span class="i1">See how they gather!
etc.</span></div>
</div>

<p>So, too, reading may be slow from the exact opposite of these
two reasons. First, when there is a great back-ground of thought
suggested by the words, and second, when the reflective and
meditative nature of the thought leads to slow action on the part
of the mind. In some selections both of these conditions are
present; in others only one of them. In <i>The Day is Done</i> (p.
<a href="#Page_63">63</a>) there is little thought below the
surface; but the reading is slow because the quiet, meditative
nature of the thought tends to slow mental action:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">And the night shall be filled
with music,</span> <span class="i1">And the cares that infest the
day,</span> <span class="i0">Shall fold their tents, like the
Arabs,</span> <span class="i1">And as silently steal
away.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg
14]</a></span></p>

<p>Both conditions, however, exist in the lines from <i>Barbara
Frietchie</i> which describe the effect produced on Stonewall
Jackson by Barbara Frietchie's heroic action and daring speech:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">A shade of sadness, a blush of
shame,</span> <span class="i0">Over the face of the leader
came.</span></div>
</div>

<p>A great many thoughts are suggested by these two lines. The
heart of the gallant Southerner is touched at the sight of this
weak, decrepit old woman with the courage and boldness of youth,
ready to die for her principles. His stern features relax and a
look of sadness passes over his face. The taunting words "spare
your country's flag" have struck home. The tragic side of civil war
is forced upon him&mdash;father fighting against son, and brother
against brother, the sons of freedom firing at their own
star-spangled banner. The sorrow and the shame of it all rise
before him, and the crimson flush mounts to his brow. With this
undercurrent of thought in the mind, it is impossible to read
rapidly. Besides, the reflective nature of the thoughts themselves
tends to make one repeat the words slowly.</p>

<p>Sometimes, again, reading is faster than the moderate rate
because of the unimportance of the events or facts:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">He spoke of the grass, the
flowers and the trees,</span> <span class="i0">Of the singing birds
and the humming bees;</span> <span class="i0">Then talked of the
haying, and wondered whether</span> <span class="i0">The cloud in
the west would bring foul weather.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Note the lightness with which the unimportant details of
conversation are skimmed over.</p>

<p><b>Inflection.</b> If we listen to the speech of the people
around us, we can easily detect an upward slide of the voice on
some words, a downward slide on others, and on others again a
combination of the two. This slide of the voice on
words&mdash;generally on the accented syllable of an emphatic <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg
15]</a></span>word&mdash;is called <b>inflection</b>, and the
various inflections are known as <i>rising</i> (/), <i>falling</i>
(\), <i>rising circumflex</i> (\/), and <i>falling</i> circumflex
(/\).</p>

<p>Each inflection has a definite and fixed meaning recognized by
every one, and it is because of the laws of inflection that we can
tell what meaning a speaker intends to convey when he uses certain
words; for often the same words may carry two or three different
meanings according to the inflection. The simple word "Yes," with
an abrupt downward slide, expresses decided affirmation. When
spoken with an upward slide, it expresses interrogation and is
equivalent to "Is that really so?" When it has a combination of the
downward and upward slide or a rising circumflex inflection, the
meaning is no longer simple but complex. There is an assertion
combined with doubt. It is equivalent to saying: "I think so but I
am not really sure." In such a sentence as: "Do not say 'yes,'"
where the idea "but say 'no,'" is merely implied, but not formally
expressed, the word "yes" has a combination of the upward and
downward slide or a falling circumflex inflection.</p>

<p>If we take an idea for its own sake, if it is independent and
complete in itself, the voice has the downward slide or falling
inflection on the words which stand for the central idea:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">My good blade carves the
casques of men,</span> <span class="i1">My tough lance thrusteth
sure,</span> <span class="i0">My strength is as the strength of
ten,</span> <span class="i1">Because my heart is pure.</span> <span
class="i0">The shattering trumpet shrilleth high,</span> <span
class="i1">The hard brands shiver on the steel,</span> <span class=
"i0">The splinter'd spear-shafts crack and fly,</span> <span class=
"i1">The horse and rider reel.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Each statement is complete in itself and has the falling
inflection.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is a slight downward slide before the statement
is completed, because the mind feels that the ideas <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>already
expressed are of sufficient force to give them the value of
completeness:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">My strength is as the strength
of t&egrave;n,</span> <span class="i1">Because my heart is
pure.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the sick men down in the hold were most of
them stark and c&ograve;ld,</span> <span class="i0">And the pikes
were all broken or b&egrave;nt, and the powder was all of it
sp&egrave;nt;</span> <span class="i0">And the masts and the rigging
were lying over the side.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Note the momentary completeness on "ten," "cold," "bent," and
"spent," requiring the falling inflection.</p>

<p>If on the other hand an idea is incomplete, either pointing
forward to some other idea or being subordinate, the voice has the
upward slide or rising inflection. The rising inflection, like the
falling, may be long or short, more or less abrupt, according to
the importance of the thought:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Sh&eacute;, with all a
monarch's pr&iacute;de,</span> <span class="i0">Felt them in her
bosom glow.</span></div>
</div>

<p>"She" points forward to the predicate "felt" and because of the
importance of the idea it takes a long rising inflection; "with all
a monarch's pride" being subordinate and incomplete also requires
the voice to be kept up, but takes a shorter rising inflection.</p>

<p>It is of the greatest importance to know the exact purpose of
the thought, so that the voice may, of itself, give the
corresponding inflection:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">And you may gather
garl&aacute;nds th&eacute;re</span> <span class="i0">Would grace a
summer qu&egrave;en.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The sense is evidently not complete in the first line, the
intention being to emphasize the beauty of the garlands to be
gathered, and not merely to state that they may be gathered <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg
17]</a></span>there. When the reader understands the exact meaning
he will convey it by keeping the rising inflection on
"garlands."</p>

<p>Similar to the foregoing is the following:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">There is not a w&iacute;fe in
the w&eacute;st c&oacute;untry</span> <span class="i0">But has
heard of the W&egrave;ll of St. K&egrave;yne.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The sense is not complete until we read the second line. The
rising inflection on "country" indicates this and connects the
first line with the second, bringing out the meaning, that every
wife in the west country has heard of the Well of St. Keyne.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have a series of rising inflections, all pointing
forward to the leading statement which is to follow and which is
necessary to complete the sense, for example:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Of man's first
disob&eacute;dience and the fr&uacute;it</span> <span class="i0">Of
that forbidden tr&eacute;e, whose mortal t&aacute;ste</span> <span
class="i0">Brought d&eacute;ath into the w&oacute;rld, and all our
w&oacute;e,</span> <span class="i0">With loss of &Eacute;den, till
one greater m&aacute;n</span> <span class="i0">Rest&oacute;re us,
and reg&aacute;in the blissful s&eacute;at,</span> <span class=
"i0">Sing, he&agrave;venly M&ugrave;se.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Incompleteness may be suggested by a negative statement or its
equivalent:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">N&oacute;t from the grand old
m&aacute;sters,</span> <span class="i1">N&oacute;t from the
b&aacute;rds sublime,</span> <span class="i0">Whose distant
footsteps echo</span> <span class="i1">Through the corridors of
Time.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I do not know what I was pl&aacute;ying,</span>
<span class="i1">Or what I was dr&eacute;aming th&eacute;n,</span>
<span class="i0">But I struck one chord of music</span> <span
class="i1">Like the sound of a great Amen.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Note the rising inflection on these negative clauses.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg
18]</a></span></p>

<p>On the same principle the rising inflection is used on the
negative statements of persuasive argument as in the <i>Apology of
Socrates</i> (p. <a href="#Page_145">145</a>).</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>But I thought that I ought not to do anything common or mean, in
the hour of danger: nor do I now repent of the manner of my
defence.</p>

<p>For neither in war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way
of escaping death.</p>

<p>Not so; the deficiency which led to my conviction was not of
words&mdash;certainly not.</p>
</div>

<p>Doubt and hesitation also imply incompleteness:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">He surely would do desperate
things to show his love of me!</span> <span class="i0">King,
ladies, lovers, all look on; the chance is wondrous fine;</span>
<span class="i0">I'll drop my glove to prove his love; great glory
will be mine!</span></div>
</div>

<p>Note the rising inflection on the first two lines where the lady
is still in doubt as to what shall be the test of De Lorge's love,
and the falling inflection on the last one when she has reached a
decision.</p>

<p>Pleading and entreaty also convey a sense of incompleteness and
take the rising inflection:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Good friends, sweet friends,
let me not stir you up</span> <span class="i0">To such a sudden
flood of mutiny.</span> <span class="i0b">&nbsp;</span> <span
class="i0">Good Sir Richard, tell us now,</span> <span class=
"i0">For to fight is but to die!</span></div>
</div>

<p>A direct interrogation, that is, one that can be answered by
"Yes" or "No", implies incompleteness in the mind of the questioner
and requires a decided rising inflection:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Is your name
Sh&yacute;lock?</span> <span class="i0b">&nbsp;</span> <span class=
"i0">May you st&eacute;ad me? Will you pl&eacute;asure me? Shall I
kn&oacute;w your &aacute;nswer?</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg
19]</a></span></p>

<p>Questions that require an explanatory answer and cannot be
answered by "Yes" or "No," do not convey an idea of incompleteness,
being merely equivalent to the statement of a desire for certain
information. Consequently they take the falling inflection:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0"><i>Flav.</i> Spe&agrave;k,
wh&agrave;t tr&agrave;de art th&ograve;u?</span> <span class=
"i0"><i>1st Cit.</i> Why, sir, a carpenter.</span> <span class=
"i0"><i>Mar.</i> Where is thy leather &agrave;pron, and thy
r&ugrave;le?</span> <span class="i0">What dost thou with thy best
app&agrave;rel &ograve;n?&mdash;</span> <span class="i0">You, sir,
wh&agrave;t tr&agrave;de are yo&ugrave;?</span></div>
</div>

<p>The purpose or motive of a question must be considered. We must
know whether the question is asked for information, or whether its
purpose is to give information; that is, whether it is only another
way of making an assertion&mdash;what is sometimes called a
question of appeal. When Shylock asks Portia: "Shall I not have
barely my principal?" he does so with the direct purpose of
learning his sentence. His question can be answered by "Yes" or
"No" and the rising inflection is used. But when he asks: "On what
compulsion must I?" he means simply to give the information that
there is no power on earth to compel him. This is a complete
thought, hence the falling inflection. Other examples are:</p>

<p class="two">Have you e'er heard of gallant like young
Lochinvar?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i2">God of battles, was ever a
battle like this in the world before?</span><br />
<span class="i2">What conquest brings he home?</span> <span class=
"i2">What tributaries follow him to Rome,</span> <span class=
"i2">To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?</span></div>
</div>

<p>The opposite inflections on antithetical words or phrases are
also due to this law of completeness and incompleteness. The first
part of the antithesis usually has the rising <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
20]</a></span>inflection marking incompleteness, and the second,
the falling, marking completeness.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">H&iacute;s blast is heard at
merry m&oacute;rn,</span> <span class="i0">And m&igrave;ne at
d&egrave;ad of n&igrave;ght.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>For this thy brother was d&eacute;ad, and is &agrave;live again;
and was l&oacute;st, and is fo&ugrave;nd.</p>
</div>

<p>Similarly, in a series of words or phrases parallel in
construction, all have the rising inflection but the last:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>As C&aelig;sar l&oacute;ved me, I w&eacute;ep for him; as he was
fort&uacute;nate, I rej&oacute;ice at it; as he was
v&aacute;l&iacute;ant, I h&oacute;nour him; but as he was
amb&igrave;tious, I sl&egrave;w him! There is te&aacute;rs for his
l&oacute;ve; j&oacute;y for his f&oacute;rtune; h&oacute;nour for
his v&aacute;lour; and de&agrave;th for his amb&igrave;tion.</p>

<p>Cr&aacute;fty men cont&eacute;mn studies; s&iacute;mple men
adm&iacute;re them; and w&igrave;se men &ugrave;se them.</p>
</div>

<p>If one part of the antithesis is a negation, it takes the rising
inflection, whether it comes first or second. This is owing to the
fact that, as illustrated above, a negation implies incompleteness.
The other part then takes the falling inflection:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Fall into the hands of
G&ograve;d, not into the hands of Sp&aacute;in.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I come to b&ugrave;ry C&aelig;sar, not to
pr&aacute;ise him.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I said an &egrave;lder soldier, not a
b&eacute;tter.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Often only one part of the antithesis is expressed, the contrast
being implied. In such a case, the voice brings out the contrast by
placing a combination of the two inflections of the regularly
expressed antithesis on the one word <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>which does duty for both
parts: Cassius says: "I said an elder soldier, not a better" in
reply to Brutus' speech&mdash;"You say you are a better soldier."
The antithesis is fully expressed, and the voice places the falling
inflection on "elder" and the rising inflection on "better." If
Cassius had omitted the words "not a better," the very same meaning
could have been conveyed by placing a combination of the rising and
the falling inflection or a falling circumflex on the word "elder,"
thus&mdash;"I said an &ecirc;lder soldier." In the next line he
goes on to say "Did I say b&#277;tter?" Here, there is an implied
contrast with "elder," which is expressed by a combination of the
falling and the rising inflection or a rising circumflex. From
these two examples, we can see that the law of completeness and
incompleteness holds good with the compound or circumflex
inflection, just as it does with the simple inflection, and
determines whether the circumflex shall be rising or falling.</p>

<p>A very common mistake in reading is to use the circumflex
inflection in emphasizing a word, thus making a contrast where none
is intended. "Ramped and roared the lions" with a falling
circumflex inflection on "lions," instead of a simple falling
inflection, suggests that the tigers or some other animals did not
ramp and roar. For similar reasons, avoid the circumflex when
emphasizing "hand" and "feet" in "put a ring on his hand and shoes
on his feet."</p>

<p>As has already been stated, it is necessary to know the motive
behind the words. When Shylock says: "O wise and upright judge,"
his intention is evidently to bestow sincere praise. The reader,
knowing this, instinctively gives a straight slide. Later, when
Gratiano says: "O upright judge, O learned judge!" his intention is
to taunt and hold up to ridicule; there is a double meaning
conveyed, which finds its natural expression in a curved
inflection.</p>

<p>Compare the curved inflections in the cobbler's speeches in Act
I. Scene I, of <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> (p. <a href=
"#Page_133">133</a>) when he is fencing with Marullus, with the
straight inflections of his final speech <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>when he has thrown
aside his raillery and speaks with sincerity:</p>

<p>One writer has said: "Where there is simple and genuine thought,
deep and sincere feeling, wherever the eye is single, the
inflections of the voice are straight; a crook in the mind however
is indicated by a crook in the voice."</p>

<p><b>Pitch</b> is the key of the voice. A change of pitch is a
leap from one key to another during silence. Inflection, as we have
seen, is a gradual change in the key while the voice is speaking.
The pitch or key depends upon the muscular tension of the vocal
chords, which act like the strings of a musical instrument: the
greater the tension, the higher the key. Muscular tension implies
nervous tension and this is dependent upon the mental state. If the
mind is calm, the nervous and muscular tension is normal, and the
speaker uses the key habitual to him in his ordinary speech. If the
mental state is one of excitement, the key is higher because of
greater nervous and muscular tension. If, on the other hand, the
mental state is one of depression, the key is lower because of
relaxed muscular tension.</p>

<p>In <i>The Defence of the Bridge</i> (p. <a href=
"#Page_206">206</a>) the Romans, seeing the danger of the heroes,
are wrought up to a high state of nervous tension which finds its
natural expression in the high-pitched voice:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Come back, come back
Horatius!"</span> <span class="i0">&nbsp;Loud cried the Fathers
all.</span> <span class="i0">"Back, Lartius! back Herminius!</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Back, ere the ruin fall!"</span></div>
</div>

<p>Contrast with this the lower key of Horatius, who is calm and
self-controlled:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg
23]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"O Tiber! Father Tiber!</span>
<span class="i1">To whom the Romans pray,</span> <span class="i0">A
Roman's life, a Roman's arms,</span> <span class="i1">Take thou in
charge this day!"</span></div>
</div>

<p>Observe the gradual rise in pitch with the increase of tension
or excitement in the following:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">And now he feels the
bottom;</span> <span class="i1">Now on dry earth he stands;</span>
<span class="i0">Now round him throng the Fathers</span> <span
class="i1">To press his gory hands;</span> <span class="i0">And
now, with shouts and clapping,</span> <span class="i1">And noise of
weeping loud,</span> <span class="i0">He enters through the
River-Gate,</span> <span class="i1">Borne by the joyous
crowd.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the following lines, where the Douglas holds communion with
himself, the tension is low chiefly because of his great mental
depression, and, consequently, he speaks in a low key:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Yes! all is true my fears
could frame;</span> <span class="i0">A prisoner lies the noble
Graeme,</span> <span class="i0">And fiery Roderick soon will
feel</span> <span class="i0">The vengeance of the royal
steel.</span> <span class="i0">I, only I, can ward their
fate,&mdash;</span> <span class="i0">God grant the ransom come not
late.</span> <span class="i0">The abbess hath her promise
given.</span> <span class="i0">My child shall be the bride of
Heaven:&mdash;</span> <span class="i0">Be pardoned one repining
tear!</span> <span class="i0">For he, who gave her, knows how
dear,</span> <span class="i0">How excellent! but that is by,</span>
<span class="i0">And now my business is&mdash;to die.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The low pitch is also partly due to the fact that the Douglas is
speaking to himself, and has no desire to communicate his thoughts
to another; for the effort to communicate thought causes increased
tension.</p>

<p>Again, it requires greater effort to address a person who is at
a distance than one close at hand, or to address a large <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg
24]</a></span>audience than a small one. Observe the comparatively
high pitch in which Antony (p. <a href="#Page_225">225</a>) begins
his oration:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears;</span> <span class="i0">I come to bury
C&aelig;sar, not to praise him.</span></div>
</div>

<p>If the reader wishes to give prominence to a thought, the effort
put forth causes muscular tension, resulting in a higher pitch. On
the other hand, a thought, which the reader regards as not of
special importance to the listener, finds expression in lower
pitch, more as if he were addressing himself:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Bold words!&mdash;but, though
the beast of game</span> <span class="i0">The privilege of chase
may claim,</span> <span class="i0">Though space and law the stag we
lend,</span> <span class="i0">Ere hound we slip, or bow we
bend,</span> <span class="i0">Who ever recked, where, how, or
when,</span> <span class="i0">The prowling fox was trapped or
slain?</span></div>
</div>

<p>Observe the lower pitch of the subordinate clauses in the first
four lines, and the higher pitch in the last two lines which
project the leading thought.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>"I think, boys," said the schoolmaster, when the clock struck
twelve, "that I shall give an extra half-holiday this
afternoon."</p>
</div>

<p>Similarly, the narrative clause "said the schoolmaster" which
interrupts the direct speech is read in lower pitch and is
separated by a marked pause before and after.</p>

<p>Parenthetical expressions, also for the same reason, are read in
lower pitch.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>She had not perceived&mdash;how could she until she had lived
longer?&mdash;the inmost truth of the old monk's outpourings, that
renunciation remains sorrow, though a sorrow borne willingly.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg
25]</a></span> He (Mr. Pickwick) would not deny that he was
influenced by human passions, and human feelings,
(cheers)&mdash;possibly by human weaknesses&mdash;(loud cries of
"No"); but this he would say, that if ever the fire of
self-importance broke out in his bosom, the desire to benefit the
human race in preference, effectually quenched it.</p>
</div>

<p>Passages which are collateral or co-ordinate in construction,
and equally balanced, will find their natural vocal expression in
the same pitch and, of course, the pitch varies as the attitude of
the mind changes:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Forty flags with their silver
stars,</span> <span class="i0">Forty flags with their crimson
bars,</span> <span class="i0">Flapped in the morning wind: the
sun</span> <span class="i0">Of noon looked down and saw not
one.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The first two lines have the same pitch, because there is no
difference in intensity of feeling or in the mental conception.
There is, however, an entire change of thought beginning with "the
sun." This is accompanied by a change of pitch.</p>

<p><b>Force.</b> Force is vocal energy; in other words, it is the
power or volume of the voice, and is determined by the amount of
physical and mental energy exerted by the speaker.</p>

<p>The language of everyday conversation, when not marked by
intensity of feeling or purpose, requires only a moderate amount of
physical and mental energy and is expressed by <i>moderate
force</i>. Intensity of feeling or purpose, on the other hand, is
accompanied by a great expenditure of energy, and finds its natural
outlet in <i>strong force</i>. In the following lines, (p. <a href=
"#Page_132">132</a>) the king's emphatic approval of De Lorge's
action and his vehement condemnation of the lady's vanity find
expression in strong force:</p>

<p class="two">"In truth!" cried Francis, "rightly done!" and he
rose from where he sat:</p>

<p class="two">"No love," quoth he, "but vanity, sets love a task
like that!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg
26]</a></span></p>

<p>Compare the moderate amount of energy expended in uttering the
narrative clauses "cried Francis," "and he rose from where he sat,"
and "quoth he," which should be read with moderate force.</p>

<p>More physical energy is expended in making one's self understood
at a distance than near at hand, and in addressing a large audience
than a small one; hence strong force is used in the following where
it is accompanied by a loud tone of voice:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Come back, come back
Horatius!"</span> <span class="i0">&nbsp;Loud cried the Fathers
all.</span></div>
</div>

<p>But strong force does not necessarily imply a loud tone of
voice:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Curse on him!" quoth false
Sextus;</span> <span class="i1">"Will not the villain drown?</span>
<span class="i0">But for this stay, ere close of day</span> <span
class="i1">We should have sacked the town!"</span></div>
</div>

<p>Here Sextus gives vent to his concentrated hate for Horatius and
speaks with strong force, but not in a loud tone of voice.</p>

<p>The effort to influence the mind and action of others draws on a
great fund of mental energy; hence commands, persuasion, and
argument, all find their vocal expression in strong force.
Herv&eacute; Riel, urging the captains to allow him to pilot the
ships, speaks with strong force:</p>

<p class="two">Sirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe me
there's a way!</p>

<p class="two">Only let me lead the line,</p>

<p>When the mental or physical energy is at a low ebb we speak with
<i>weak force</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">But all that I could think of,
in the darkness and the cold,</span> <span class="i0">Was just that
I was leaving home, and my folks were growing old.</span> <span
class="i0"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg
27]</a></span>Take me out, sink me deep in the green
profound,</span> <span class="i0">To sway with the long-weed, swing
with the drowned,</span> <span class="i0">Where the change of the
soft tide makes no sound,</span> <span class="i0">Far below the
keels of the outward bound.</span></div>
</div>

<p>For the same reason such poems as <i>The Day is Done</i>, (p. <a
href="#Page_63">63</a>) and Part IV, of <i>The Lady of Shalott</i>,
(p. <a href="#Page_200">200</a>) are read with gentle force.</p>

<p>A change in force often accompanies a change in pitch. The lower
pitch of parenthetical expressions, and narrative clauses which
interrupt direct discourse, is accompanied by weaker force, and the
higher pitch resulting from the efforts to make one's self heard at
a distance is accompanied by stronger force.</p>

<p><b>Stress</b> is force applied to the vowel sound. When we are
taken by surprise and give expression to it by means of the one
word "Oh," we apply the force or volume of the voice to the
beginning of the vowel sound. This is called <i>initial or radical
stress</i> (&gt;) to a statement, or to insist on a refusal to some
persistent request we say "No," gradually increasing the force of
the voice to the last part of the vowel sound. This is called
<i>final</i> or <i>vanishing stress</i> (&lt;). Again, if our minds
are uplifted with wonder and delight at something we have heard or
seen, we exclaim "Oh" applying the force to the middle of the vowel
sound. This swell of the vowel sound is called <i>median stress</i>
(&lt;&gt;).</p>

<p>It has already been pointed out that force depends upon the
<i>amount</i> of energy. The above examples show that stress or the
location of force depends upon the <i>kind</i> of mental energy, or
the attitude of mind, whether it be that of abruptness, of
insistence, or of uplift.</p>

<p>All speech has a slight tendency toward initial stress, because
the effort made by the vocal chords to articulate sound is
characterized by abruptness. If, in addition, the mental energy of
the speaker possesses abruptness through sudden impulse or emotion,
or through unconscious imitation <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>of sound or movement, the
initial stress is very prominent:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0"><i>Where</i> is thy leather
apron, and thy rule?</span> <span class="i0"><i>What</i> dost thou
with thy best apparel on?&mdash;</span> <span class=
"i0"><i>You</i>, sir, <i>what trade</i> are
<i>you</i>?</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Quick</i>, as it fell, from the broken
staff</span> <span class="i0">Dame Barbara <i>snatched</i> the
silken scarf.</span><br />
<span class="i0">She leaned far out on the window-sill,</span>
<span class="i0">And <i>shook</i> it forth with a royal
will.</span></div>
</div>

<p class="two">While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came
a tapping,</p>

<p class="two">As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber
door.</p>

<p>If the speaker desires to impress on others his own feelings or
convictions, the final stress is the result. Such insistence is
found in the expression of anger, scorn, indignation, and
determination:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0"><i>Burn</i> the fleet and
<i>ruin</i> France?</span> <span class="i0">That were <i>worse</i>
than <i>fifty</i> Hogues!</span> <span class="i0">Sirs, they
<i>know</i> I speak the truth!</span> <span class="i0">Sirs,
<i>believe</i> me, <i>there's a way</i>!</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the first two lines Herv&eacute; Riel wishes to make others
feel his own indignation at the thought of burning the fleet. In
the last two, he tries to impress them with his conviction that
there is a way out of the difficulty. Hence the final stress in
each case.</p>

<p>Sometimes the speaker tries to enforce his own opinion by
peevishness, whining, or complaining, with the result that he uses
the final stress:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>. Then <i>why</i> will you <i>endeavour</i> to
make yourself so <i>disagreeable</i> to me, and <i>thwart</i> me in
<i>every little elegant expense</i>?</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>. Madam, I say, had you any of these little
elegant expenses when you married me?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg
29]</a></span><i>Lady Teazle</i>. <i>Sir Peter!</i> would you have
me be <i>out of the fashion</i>?</p>
</div>

<p>If the mental energy or mental attitude is one of uplift or
exaltation, expressing itself in adoration of the Deity, or in
admiration and love of the beautiful, or in sympathy and tenderness
toward mankind, the median stress is used:</p>

<p class="two">Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within
me, bless his holy name.</p>

<p class="two"><i>Roll on</i>, thou <i>deep</i> and <i>dark</i>
blue ocean&mdash;<i>roll</i>!</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Dear lost companions of my
tuneful art,</span> <span class="i1">Dear as the light that visits
these sad eyes,</span> <span class="i0">Dear as the ruddy drops
that warm my heart,</span> <span class="i1">Ye died amidst your
dying country's cries.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Determination and settled conviction in the speaker's mind,
especially when accompanied by a marked degree of dignity,
calmness, and self-control, cause equal stress on every part of the
vowel sound. This is called <i>thorough stress</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">If every ducat in six thousand
ducats</span> <span class="i0">Were in six parts, and every part a
ducat,</span> <span class="i0">I would not draw them; I would have
my bond.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It is the stress of quiet strength and great reserve force:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Though the water flashed
around them,</span> <span class="i1"><i>Not an eye was seen to
quiver</i>;</span> <span class="i0">Though the shot flew sharp and
deadly,</span> <span class="i1"><i>Not a man relax'd his
hold</i>.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In a more marked degree, it is also the stress used in
calling:</p>

<p class="two">Then rose a warning cry behind, a joyous shout
before:</p>

<p class="two">"The current's strong,&mdash;the way is
long,&mdash;they'll never reach the shore!</p>

<p class="two">See, see! they stagger in the midst, they waver in
their line!</p>

<p class="two">Fire on the madmen! break their ranks, and whelm
them in the Rhine!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg
30]</a></span></p>

<p>If the speaker's attitude of mind is not straightforward and
sincere, if he speaks with a double meaning, in irony or sarcasm,
the stress is a combination of the radical and final, known as
<i>compound stress</i> (&gt;&lt;). This is analogous to the
compound inflection. See page <a href="#Page_21">21</a>.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Now welcome, welcome,
Sextus!</span> <span class="i1">Now welcome to thy home!</span>
<span class="i0">Why dost thou stay, and turn away?</span> <span
class="i1">Here lies the road to Rome.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Accordingly, the compound stress is used when the intention is
to taunt or to ridicule:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p><i>Sir Peter</i>. Ay&mdash;there again&mdash;taste! Zounds!
Madam, you had no taste when you married me!</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>. <i>That's very true</i>, indeed, Sir Peter!
and after having married <i>you</i>, I should <i>never pretend to
taste again</i>, I allow.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Emphasis</b>&mdash;The importance of an idea, whether this
idea is expressed by a single word, or by a phrase or clause, is
indicated by a variation of pitch, force, or time. This change in
pitch, force, or time, by attracting attention to that idea, is a
means of emphasis. It is the new idea, or the idea which is
important through contrast either expressed or implied, which will
attract the reader's attention and which he will make prominent in
this way:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0b"><i>Brutus</i>. You say you
are a <i>better soldier</i>:</span> <span class="i2">Let it
<i>appear</i> so; make your vaunting <i>true</i>,</span> <span
class="i2">And it shall <i>please me well</i>: for mine own
part,</span> <span class="i2">I shall be <i>glad</i> to learn of
noble men.</span><br />
<span class="i0b"><i>Cassius</i>. You <i>wrong</i> me every way;
you <i>wrong</i> me, Brutus;</span> <span class="i2">I said, an
<i>elder</i> soldier, not a <i>better</i>:</span></div>
</div>

<p>"better soldier," "appear," and "true" are central ideas; they
express important ideas not mentioned before. When Cassius replies
he at once throws the idea of "soldier" in the back-ground and
emphasizes "better" by contrasting it with <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>"elder." He also
introduces the new idea "wrong" which he makes still more emphatic
by repetition. Brutus also introduces the new idea "please me well"
which he makes emphatic by repeating it in the word "glad." Other
examples of words and phrases becoming more emphatic through
repetition are:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Faster come, faster
come;</span> <span class="i1">Faster and faster,</span> <span
class=
"i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span>
<span class="i0">Fast they come, fast they come;</span></div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class=
"i0">"<i>Jump</i>&mdash;far&mdash;out boy into the wave,</span>
<span class="i1"><span class="smcap">Jump</span>, or I fire," he
said,</span> <span class="i0">"This chance alone your life can
save:</span> <span class="i1">JUMP, JUMP."</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the case of a climax, the emphasis grows stronger on each
member of the series:</p>

<p class="two">"Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!"
cried its chief.</p>

<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="two">It is enthron&eacute;d in the hearts of Kings,</p>

<p class="two">It is an attribute to God himself.</p>

<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="two">When a wind from the lands they had ruin'd awoke
from sleep,</p>

<p class="two">And the water began to heave and the weather to
moan,</p>

<p class="two">And or ever that evening ended a great gale
blew,</p>

<p class="two">And a wave like the wave that is raised by an
earthquake grew,</p>

<p class="two">Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and
their masts and their flags.</p>

<p>However, if a word is repeated, it is not necessarily emphatic
each time:</p>

<p class="two">The German heart is stout and true, the German arm
is strong;</p>

<p class="two">The German foot goes seldom back where arm&egrave;d
foemen throng.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg
32]</a></span></p>

<p>In the phrase "The German heart" the chief emphasis is on
"heart," with a slighter emphasis on German. The emphasis is then
transferred to "arm" and "foot" through contrast with "heart." To
emphasize "German" again would weaken the effect.</p>

<p>Compare the repetition, in the following, of the syllable "un,"
also of the phrase "this year":</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Unwatched along
Clitumnus</span> <span class="i1">Grazes the milk-white
steer;</span> <span class="i0">Unharmed the water-fowl may

<span class="i0">The harvests of Arretium,</span> <span class=
"i1">This year, old men shall reap,</span> <span class="i0">This

<span class="i0">Round the white feet of laughing girls</span>
<span class="i1">Whose sires have marched to Rome.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Words and phrases are emphatic quite as often through contrast
implied as through contrast expressed. It is evident that such a
sentence as: "Will you ride to town to-day?" may have a number of
different meanings according to the words emphasized. This
difference of meaning is due to an implied contrast. If "you" is
emphatic, it is because there is a mental contrast between "you"
and some other person. If "ride" is emphatic, it is because riding
is being contrasted with walking or driving and so on. The
following contain examples of emphasis through implied
contrast:</p>

<p class="two"><i>Great</i> things were ne'er begotten in an
hour.</p>

<p class="two">But <i>now</i> no sound of laughter was heard among
the foes.</p>

<p>As already shown on page <a href="#Page_21">21</a>, the
emphasis, in the case of implied contrast, is brought out by the
circumflex inflection.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg

<p><b>Shading</b> and <b>Perspective</b>. These deal with the
relative importance of words, phrases, or clauses. According as an
idea suggested by a word or group of words is regarded as principal
or subordinate, the voice either projects it or holds it in the
back-ground as an artist shades his picture:</p>

<p class="two">And, though the legend does not live,&mdash;for
legends lightly die&mdash;</p>

<p class="two">The peasant, as he sees the stream in winter rolling
by,</p>

<p class="two">And foaming o'er its channel-bed between him and the
spot</p>

<p class="two">Won by the warriors of the sword, still calls that
deep and dangerous ford</p>

<p class="two">The Passage of the Scot.</p>

<p>The principal statement, "The peasant still calls that deep and
dangerous ford the Passage of the Scot," is projected or emphasized
by higher pitch and stronger force, the thought being sustained,
and the connection made between "The peasant" and "still calls" by
means of the rising inflection. The subordinate statements, "though
the legend does not live" and "as he sees the stream in winter
rolling by ... sword," are kept in the back-ground by slightly
lower pitch and moderate force. The parenthetical clause, "for
legends lightly die," is subordinate to the subordinate statement
and is thrown still more into the back-ground in the same way as
the preceding.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the term "shading" is used to indicate the
value of individual phrases or clauses; "perspective," to indicate
the values of several phrases or clauses viewed relatively.</p>

<p>The <b>quality</b>, or timbre, of the voice reveals the
speaker's emotions, their character, number, and intensity. The
voice is affected by the muscular texture of the throat, just as
the tone of an instrument is affected by the texture of the
material of which it is made. This muscular texture is affected by
nerve and muscular vibrations which are caused by emotion, the
result of mental impressions. Whatever be the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>quality
of voice peculiar to the individual, it is greatly modified by his
emotions. The man of few emotions has few vocal vibrations; hence
his monotonous voice. The man whose emotions are habitually cruel,
has a harsh, hard muscular texture through contraction of the
muscles; hence the hard voice. It is plain that the natural voice
is an index to the character. If the imagination and soul are
cultivated, the voice will gain in richness and fulness. If, in
reading that which expresses the sublime, noble, and grand, the
imagination is kindled, the voice will express by its vibrations
the largeness of our conception. This full, rich voice is called
the <i>orotund</i>:</p>

<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">These are the gardens of the
Desert, these</span> <span class="i0">The unshorn fields, boundless

<p class="two">For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great

<p class="two">As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he

<p>In thinking of what is stern, severe, harsh, cruel, or base, the

known as the <i>guttural</i>:</p>

</div>

<p>Certain states of mind, such as awe, caution, secrecy, fear,
etc., produce in greater or less degree an aspirated or "breathy"
quality, called the <i>whisper</i> or <i>aspirate</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">When Jubal struck the chorded
shell,</span> <span class="i1">His listening brethren stood

class="i0">The larkspur listens, "I hear, I hear;"</span> <span
class="i1">And the lily whispers, "I wait."</span></div>
</div>

<p>The atmosphere of hush and repose expresses itself by a partial
whisper:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Ne'er saw I, never felt, a
calm so deep!</span> <span class="i1">The river glideth at his own
sweet will:</span> <span class="i0">Dear God! the very houses seem
asleep;</span> <span class="i1">And all that mighty heart is lying
still!</span></div>
</div>

<p>It must not be supposed that the whisper is always associated
with moderate or with weak force as in the preceding examples.
Strong force is used with the whisper to express intensity of
feeling or vehemence:</p>

<p class="two">Whispering with white lips: the foe! they come! they
come!</p>

<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="two">Hush, I say, hush!</p>

<p>Other emotional states have their corresponding qualities of
voice, such, for example, as the quality of oppressed feeling and
the quality expressing agitation.</p>

<p>To conclude: it must be carefully borne in mind that the reader
should never strive to produce a certain quality apart from the
emotion which should precede. By force alone, for example, he will
succeed in producing mere sound without the quality. Nor are any of
the examples given above, in dealing with the various elements of
vocal expression, intended for practice in voice gymnastics apart
from the preliminary state of which they are the vocal expression.
They are intended merely as illustrations of the laws which govern
correct speech.</p>

<h3>JEAN VALJEAN AND THE BISHOP</h3>

<div class="center2">From "Les Mis&eacute;rables"</div>

<p>At the bishop's house, his housekeeper, Mme. Magloire was
saying:</p>

<p>"We say that this house is not safe at all; and, if Monseigneur
will permit me, I will go on and tell the locksmith to come and put
the old bolts in the door again. I say, than a door which opens by
a latch on the outside to the first comer, nothing could be more
horrible; and then Monseigneur has the habit of always saying:
'Come in,' even at midnight. But, my goodness, there is no need to
even ask leave&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment there was a violent knock on the door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" said the bishop.</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>It opened quickly, quite wide, as if pushed by some one boldly
and with energy.</p>

<p>A man entered.</p>

<p>That man we know already; it was the traveller we have seen
wandering about in search of a lodging.</p>

<p>He came in, took one step, and paused, leaving the door open
behind him. He had his knapsack on his back, his stick in his hand,
and a rough, hard, and fierce look in his eyes. He was hideous.</p>

<p>The bishop looked upon the man with a tranquil eye. As he was
opening his mouth to speak, doubtless to ask the stranger what he
wanted, the man, leaning with both hands on his club, glanced from
one to another in turn, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id=
"Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>and, without waiting for the bishop to
speak, said, in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"See here! my name is Jean Valjean. I am a convict; I have been
nineteen years in the galleys. Four days ago I was set free, and
started for Pontarlier; during these four days I have walked from
Toulon. To-day I have walked twelve leagues. When I reached this
place this evening I went to an inn, and they sent me away on
account of my yellow passport, which I had shown at the Mayor's
office, as was necessary. I went to another inn; they said, 'Get
out!' It was the same with one as with another; nobody would have
me. I went to the prison and the turnkey would not let me in. I
crept into a dog kennel, the dog bit me, and drove me away as if he
had been a man; you would have said that he knew who I was. I went
into the fields to sleep beneath the stars, there were no stars. I
thought it would rain, and there was no good God to stop the drops,
so I came back to the town to get the shelter of some doorway.
There in the square I laid down upon a stone; a good woman showed
me your house, and said: 'Knock there!' I have knocked. What is
this place? Are you an inn? I have money; my savings, one hundred
and nine francs and fifteen sous, which I have earned in the
galleys by my work for nineteen years. I will pay. What do I care?
I have money, I am very tired&mdash;twelve leagues on
foot&mdash;and I am so hungry. Can I stay?"</p>

<p>"Mme. Magloire," said the bishop, "put on another plate."</p>

<p>The man took three steps and came near the lamp which stood on
the table. "Stop," he exclaimed; as if he had not been understood;
"not that, did you understand me? I am a galley slave&mdash;a
convict&mdash;I am just <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id=
"Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>from the galleys." He drew from his
pocket a large sheet of yellow paper, which he unfolded. "There is
my passport, yellow, as you see. That is enough to have me kicked
out wherever I go. Will you read it? See, here is what they have
put on my passport: Jean Valjean, a liberated convict; has been
nineteen years in the galleys; five years for burglary; fourteen
years for having attempted four times to escape. This man is very
dangerous. There you have it! Everybody has thrust me out; will you
receive me? Is this an inn? Can you give me something to eat and a
place to sleep? Have you a stable?"</p>

<p>"Mme. Magloire," said the bishop, "put some sheets on the bed in
the alcove."</p>

<p>The bishop turned to the man:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, sit down and warm yourself; we are going to take
supper presently, and your bed will be made ready while you
sup."</p>

<p>At last the man quite understood; his face, the expression of
which till then had been gloomy, and hard, now expressed
stupefaction, doubt and joy, and became absolutely wonderful. He
began to stutter like a madman.</p>

<p>"True? What? You will keep me? you won't drive me away&mdash;a
convict? You call me monsieur and don't say, 'Get out, dog!' as
everybody else does. I shall have a supper! a bed like other
people, with mattress and sheets&mdash;a bed! It is nineteen years
that I have not slept on a bed. You are good people! Besides, I
have money; I will pay well. I beg your pardon, M. Innkeeper, what
is your name? I will pay all you say. You are a fine man. You are
an innkeeper, is it not so?"</p>

<p>"I am a priest who lives here," said the bishop.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg
41]</a></span></p>

<p>"A priest," said the man. "Oh, noble priest! Then you do not ask
any money?"</p>

<p>"No," said the bishop, "keep your money. How much have you?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and nine francs and fifteen sous," said the
man.</p>

<p>"One hundred and nine francs and fifteen sous. And how long did
it take you to earn that?"</p>

<p>"Nineteen years."</p>

<p>"Nineteen years!"</p>

<p>The bishop sighed deeply, and shut the door, which had been left
wide open.</p>

<p>Mme. Magloire brought in a plate and set it on the table.</p>

<p>"Mme Magloire," said the bishop, "put this plate as near the
fire as you can." Then turning toward his guest he added: "The
night wind is raw in the Alps; you must be cold, monsieur."</p>

<p>Every time he said the word <i>monsieur</i> with his gentle,
solemn and heartily hospitable voice, the man's countenance lighted
up. <i>Monsieur</i> to a convict is a glass of water to a man dying
of thirst at sea.</p>

<p>"The lamp," said the bishop, "gives a very poor light."</p>

<p>Mme. Magloire understood him, and, going to his bedchamber, took
from the mantel the two silver candlesticks, lighted the candles
and placed them on the table.</p>

<p>"M. le Cur&eacute;," said the man, you are good; "you don't
despise me. You take me into your house; you light your candles for
me, and I haven't hid from you where I come from, and how miserable
I am."</p>

<p>The bishop touched his hand gently and said: "You need not tell
me who you are. This is not my house; it <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>is the house of
Christ. It does not ask any comer whether he has a name, but
whether he has an affliction. You are suffering; you are hungry and
thirsty; be welcome. And do not thank me; do not tell me that I
take you into my house. This is the home of no man except him who
needs an asylum. I tell you, who are a traveller, that you are more
at home here than I; whatever is here is yours. What need have I to
know your name? Besides, before you told me, I knew it."</p>

<p>The man opened his eyes in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Really? You knew my name?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the bishop, "your name is my brother."</p>

<p>"Stop, stop, M. le Cur&eacute;," exclaimed the man, "I was
famished when I came in, but you are so kind that now I don't know
what I am; that is all gone."</p>

<p>The bishop looked at him again and said:</p>

<p>"You have seen much suffering?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the red blouse, the ball and chain, the plank you sleep on,
the heat, the cold, the galley's screw, the lash, the double chain
for nothing, the dungeon for a word&mdash;even when sick in bed,
the chain. The dogs, the dogs are happier! nineteen years! and I am
forty-six, and now a yellow passport. That is all."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the bishop, "you have left a place of suffering.
But listen, there will be more joy in heaven over the tears of a
repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred good men.
If you are leaving that sorrowful place with hate and anger against
men, you are worthy of compassion; if you leave it with good-will,
gentleness, and peace, you are better than any of us."</p>

<h3>FAITH, HOPE AND CHARITY</h3>

<div class="center2">1 Corinthians xiii</div>

<p>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that
I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And
though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my
body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing.</p>

<p>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not;
charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave
itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,
thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the
truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
endureth all things.</p>

<p>Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they
shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether
there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and
we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then
that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I
spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child:
but when I became a man I put away childish things. For now we see
through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part;
but then shall I know even as also I am known.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg
47]</a></span></p>

<p>And now abideth faith, hope and charity, these three; but the
greatest of these is charity.</p>

<h3>THE VICAR'S FAMILY USE ART</h3>

<div class="center2">From "The Vicar of Wakefield"</div>

<p>1. Whatever might have been Sophia's sensations, the rest of the
family was easily consoled for Mr. Burchell's absence by the
company of our landlord, whose visits now became more frequent, and
longer. Though he had been disappointed in procuring my daughters
the amusements of the town, as he designed, he took every
opportunity of supplying them with those little recreations which
our retirement would admit of. He usually came in the morning; and
while my son and I followed our occupations abroad, he sat with the
family at home, and amused them by describing the town, with every
part of which he was particularly acquainted. He could repeat all
the observations that were retailed in the atmosphere of the
play-houses, and had all the good things of the high wits by rote,
long before they made their way into the jest-books. The intervals
between conversation were employed in teaching my daughters piquet,
or sometimes in setting my two little ones to box, to make them
<i>sharp</i>, as he called it; but the hopes of having him for a
son-in-law, in some measure blinded us to all his imperfections. It
must be owned, that my wife laid a thousand schemes to entrap him;
or, to speak it more tenderly, used every art to magnify the merit
of her daughter. If the cakes at tea ate short and crisp, they were
made by Olivia; if the gooseberry wine was well knit, the
gooseberries were of her gathering; <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>it was her fingers that
gave the pickles their peculiar green; and in the composition of a
pudding, it was her judgment that mixed the ingredients. Then the
poor woman would sometimes tell the Squire that she thought him and
Olivia extremely of a size, and would bid both stand up to see
which was tallest. These instances of cunning, which she thought
impenetrable, yet which everybody saw through, were very pleasing
to our benefactor, who gave every day some new proofs of his
passion, which, though they had not risen to proposals of marriage,
yet we thought fell but little short of it; and his slowness was
attributed sometimes to native bashfulness, and sometimes to his
fear of offending his uncle. An occurrence, however, which happened
soon after, put it beyond a doubt that he designed to become one of
our family; my wife even regarded it as an absolute promise.</p>

<p>2. My wife and daughters happening to return a visit at
neighbour Flamborough's, found that family had lately got their
pictures drawn by a limner, who travelled the country, and took
likenesses for fifteen shillings a head. As this family and ours
had long a sort of rivalry in point of taste, our spirit took the
alarm at this stolen march upon us; and notwithstanding all I could
say, and I said much, it was resolved that we should have our
pictures done too. Having, therefore, engaged the limner&mdash;for
what could I do?&mdash;our next deliberation was to shew the
superiority of our taste in the attitudes. As for our neighbour's
family, there were seven of them, and they were drawn with seven
oranges&mdash;a thing quite out of taste, no <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>variety
in life, no composition in the world. We desired to have something
in a brighter style; and after many debates, at length came to an
unanimous resolution of being drawn together, in one large
historical family piece. This would be cheaper, since one frame
would serve for all, and it would be infinitely more genteel; for
all families of any taste were now drawn in the same manner. As we
did not immediately recollect an historical subject to hit us, we
were contented each with being drawn as independent historical
figures. My wife desired to be represented as Venus, and the
painter was desired not to be too frugal of his diamonds in her
stomacher and hair. Her two little ones were to be as Cupids by her
side; while I, in my gown and band, was to present her with my
books on the Whistonian controversy. Olivia would be drawn as an
Amazon, sitting upon a bank of flowers, dressed in a green joseph
richly laced with gold, and a whip in her hand. Sophia was to be a
shepherdess, with as many sheep as the painter could put in for
nothing; and Moses was to be dressed out with an hat and white
feather. Our taste so much pleased the Squire that he insisted on
being put in as one of the family, in the character of Alexander
the Great, at Olivia's feet. This was considered by us all as an
indication of his desire to be introduced into the family, nor
could we refuse his request. The painter was therefore set to work,
and as he wrought with assiduity and expedition, in less than four
days the whole was completed. The piece was large, and it must be
owned he did not spare his colours; for which my wife gave him
great encomiums. We were all perfectly satisfied with his
performance; but an unfortunate circumstance <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>which
had not occurred till the picture was finished, now struck us with
dismay. It was so very large that we had no place in the house to
fix it. How we all came to disregard so material a point is
inconceivable; but certain it is, we had been all greatly remiss.
The picture, therefore, instead of gratifying our vanity, as we
hoped, leaned, in a most mortifying manner, against the kitchen
wall, where the canvas was stretched and painted, much too large to
be got through any of the doors, and the jest of all our
neighbours. One compared it to Robinson Crusoe's long-boat, too
large to be removed; another thought it more resembled a reel in a
bottle; some wondered how it could be got out. but still more were
amazed how it ever got in.</p>

<p>3. But though it excited the ridicule of some, it effectually
raised more malicious suggestions in many. The Squire's portrait
being found united with ours, was an honour too great to escape
envy. Scandalous whispers began to circulate at our expense, and
our tranquillity was continually disturbed by persons, who came as
friends, to tell us what was said of us by enemies. These reports
we always resented with becoming spirit; but scandal ever improves
by opposition.</p>

<p>4. We once again, therefore, entered into a consultation upon
obviating the malice of our enemies, and at last came to a
resolution which had too much cunning to give me entire
satisfaction. It was this: as our principal object was to discover
the honour of Mr. Thornhill's addresses, my wife undertook to sound
him, by pretending to ask his advice in the choice of an husband
for her eldest daughter. If this was not <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>found sufficient to
induce him to a declaration, it was then resolved to terrify him
with a rival. To this last step, however, I would by no means give
my consent, till Olivia gave me the most solemn assurances that she
would marry the person provided to rival him upon this occasion, if
he did not prevent it by taking her himself. Such was the scheme
laid, which, though I did not strenuously oppose, I did not
entirely approve.</p>

<p>5. The next time, therefore, that Mr. Thornhill came to see us,
my girls took care to be out of the way, in order to give their
mamma an opportunity of putting her scheme in execution; but they
only retired to the next room, whence they could overhear the whole
conversation. My wife artfully introduced it, by observing, that
one of the Miss Flamboroughs was like to have a very good match of
it in Mr. Spanker. To this the Squire assenting, she proceeded to
remark, that they who had warm fortunes were always sure of getting
good husbands: "But heaven help," continued she, "the girls that
have none! What signifies beauty, Mr. Thornhill? or what signifies
all the virtue, and all the qualifications in the world, in this
age of self-interest? It is not, What is she? but, What has she? is
all the cry."</p>

<p>6. "Madam," returned he, "I highly approve the justice, as well
as the novelty, of your remarks, and if I were a king, it should be
otherwise. It should then, indeed, be fine times for the girls
without fortunes: our two young ladies should be the first for whom
I would provide."</p>

<p>7. "Ah, sir," returned my wife, "you are pleased to be
facetious: but I wish I were a queen, and then I <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>know
where my eldest daughter should look for an husband. But now that
you have put it into my head, seriously, Mr. Thornhill, can't you
recommend me a proper husband for her? She is now nineteen years
old, well grown and well educated, and, in my humble opinion, does
not want for parts."</p>

<p>8. "Madam," replied he, "if I were to choose, I would find out a
person possessed of every accomplishment that can make an angel
happy. One with prudence, fortune, taste, and sincerity; such,
madam, would be, in my opinion, the proper husband."&mdash;"Ay,
sir," said she, "but do you know of any such person?"&mdash;"No,
Madam," returned he, "it is impossible to know any person that
deserves to be her husband: she's too great a treasure for one
man's possession: she's a goddess! Upon my soul, I speak what I
think, she's an angel!"&mdash;"Ah, Mr. Thornhill, you only flatter
my poor girl: but we have been thinking of marrying her to one of
your tenants, whose mother is lately dead, and who wants a manager;
you know whom I mean, Farmer Williams; a warm man, Mr. Thornhill,
able to give her good bread; and who has several times made her
proposals" (which was actually the case); "but, sir," concluded
she, "I should be glad to have your approbation of our
choice."&mdash;"How, Madam," replied he, "my approbation!&mdash;my
approbation of such a choice! Never. What! Sacrifice so much
beauty, and sense, and goodness, to a creature insensible of the
blessing! Excuse me, I can never approve of such a piece of
injustice. And I have my reasons."&mdash;"Indeed, sir," cried
Deborah, "If you have your reasons, that's another affair; but I
should be glad to know those <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>reasons."&mdash;"Excuse
me, Madam," returned he, "they lie too deep for discovery" (laying
his hand upon his bosom); "they remain buried, rivetted here."</p>

<p>9. After he was gone, upon a general consultation, we could not

<h3>THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE BOYS</h3>

<div class="center2">From "The Old Curiosity Shop"</div>

<p>1. The schoolmaster had scarcely arranged the room in due order,
and taken his seat behind his desk, when a white-headed boy with a
sunburnt face appeared at the door, and stopping there to make a
rustic bow, came in and took his seat upon one of the forms. The
white-headed boy then put an open book, astonishingly dog-eared,
upon his knees, and thrusting his hands into his pockets, began
counting the marbles with which they were filled. Soon afterwards
another white-headed little boy came straggling in, and after him a
red-headed lad, and after him two more with white heads, and then
one with a flaxen poll, and so on until there were about a dozen
boys in all, with heads of every colour but gray, and ranging in
their ages from four years old to fourteen years or more; for the
legs of the youngest were a long way from the floor when he sat
upon the form, and the eldest was a heavy, good-tempered, foolish
fellow, about half a head taller than the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>2. At the top of the first form&mdash;the post of honour in the
school&mdash;was the vacant place of the little sick scholar, and
at the head of the row of pegs on which the hats and caps were
hung, one peg was left empty. No boy attempted to violate the
sanctity of seat or peg, but many a one looked from the empty
spaces to the schoolmaster, and whispered to his idle neighbour
behind his hand.</p>

<p>3. Then began the hum of conning over lessons and getting them
by heart, the whispered jest and stealthy <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>game, and all the
noise and drawl of school; and in the midst of the din sat the poor
schoolmaster, the very image of meekness and simplicity, vainly
attempting to fix his mind upon the duties of the day, and to
forget his little sick friend. But the tedium of his office
reminded him more strongly of the willing scholar, and his thoughts
were rambling from his pupils&mdash;it was plain. None knew this
better than the idlest boys, who, growing bolder with impunity,
waxed louder and more daring&mdash;eating apples under the master's
eye, pinching each other in sport or malice, and cutting their
autographs in the very legs of his desk. The puzzled dunce, who
stood beside it to say his lesson out of book, looked no longer at
the ceiling for forgotten words, but drew closer to the master's
elbow and boldly cast his eyes upon the page. If the master did
chance to rouse himself and seem alive to what was going on, the
noise subsided for a moment, and no eyes met his but wore a
studious and deeply humble look; but, the instant he relapsed
again, it broke out afresh, and ten times louder than before.</p>

<p>4. Oh, how some of those idle fellows longed to be outside, and
how they looked at the open door and window, as if they half
meditated rushing violently out, plunging into the woods, and being
wild boys and savages from that time forth. What rebellious
thoughts of the cool river, and some shady bathing-place beneath
willow-trees with branches dipping in the water, kept tempting and
urging that sturdy boy, who sat fanning his flushed face with a
spelling-book wishing himself a whale, or a fly, or anything but a
boy at school on that hot, broiling day!</p>

<p>5. Heat! Ask that other boy, whose seat being <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>nearest
the door gave him opportunities of gliding out into the garden and
driving his companions to madness by dipping his face into the
bucket of the well and then rolling on the grass&mdash;ask him if
there were ever such a day as that, when even the bees were diving
deep down into the cups of flowers and stopping there, as if they
had made up their minds to retire from business and be
manufacturers of honey no more. The day was made for laziness, and
lying on one's back in green places, and staring at the sky till
its brightness forced one to shut one's eyes and go to sleep; and
was this a time to be poring over musty books in a dark room,
slighted by the very sun itself? Monstrous!</p>

<p>6. The lessons over, writing-time began; and there being but one
desk and that the master's, each boy sat at it in turn and laboured
at his crooked copy, while the master walked about. This was a
quieter time; for he would come and look over the writer's
shoulder, and tell him mildly to observe how such a letter was
turned in such a copy on the wall, and bid him take it for his
model. Then he would stop and tell them what the sick child had
said last night, and how he had longed to be among them once again;
and such was the schoolmaster's gentle and affectionate manner that
the boys seemed quite remorseful that they had worried him so much,
and were absolutely quiet; eating no apples, cutting no names,
inflicting no pinches, for full two minutes afterwards.</p>

<p>7. "I think, boys," said the schoolmaster, when the clock struck
twelve, "that I shall give an extra half-holiday this
afternoon."</p>

<p>8. At this intelligence the boys, led on and headed by the tall
boy, raised a great shout, in the midst of which <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>the
master was seen to speak, but could not be heard. As he held up his
hand, however, in token of his wish that they should be silent,
they were considerate enough to leave off, as soon as the
longest-winded among them were quite out of breath.</p>

<p>9. "You must promise me first," said the schoolmaster, "that you
'll not be noisy, or, at least, if you are, that you'll go away and
be so&mdash;away out of the village, I mean. I'm sure you wouldn't
disturb your old playmate and companion."</p>

<p>10. There was a general murmur in the negative.</p>

<p>11. "Then, pray, don't forget&mdash;there's my dear scholars,"
said the schoolmaster&mdash;"what I have asked you, and do it as a
favour to me. Be as happy as you can, and likewise be mindful that
you are blessed with health. Good-bye, all!"</p>

<p>12. "Thank you, sir," and "Good-bye, sir," were said a great
many times in a variety of voices, and the boys went out very
slowly and softly.</p>

<p>13. But there was the sun shining and there were the birds
singing, as the sun only shines and the birds only sing on holidays
and half-holidays; there were the trees waving to all free boys to
climb and nestle among their leafy branches; the hay, entreating
them to come and scatter it in the pure air; the green corn, gently
beckoning toward wood and stream; the smooth ground rendered
smoother still by blending lights and shadows, inviting to runs and
leaps, and long walks no one knows whither. It was more than boy
could bear, and with a joyous whoop the whole company took to their
heels and spread themselves about, shouting and laughing as they
went.</p>

<p>14. "It's natural, thank heaven!" said the poor <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg
69]</a></span>schoolmaster, looking after them. "I'm very glad they
didn't mind me!"</p>

<h3>SHIPWRECKED</h3>

<div class="center2">From "Kidnapped"</div>

<p>1. The time I spent upon the island is still so horrible a
thought to me that I must pass it lightly over. In all the books I
have read of people cast away, either they had their pockets full
of tools, or a chest of things would be thrown upon the beach along
with them, as if on purpose. My case was very much different. I had
nothing in my pockets but money and Alan's silver button; and being
inland bred, I was as much short of knowledge as of means.</p>

<p>2. I knew indeed that shellfish were counted good to eat; and
among the rocks of the isle I found a great plenty of limpets,
which at first I could scarcely strike from their places, not
knowing quickness to be needful. There were, besides, some of the
little shells that we call buckies; I think periwinkle is the
English name. Of these two I made my whole diet, devouring them
cold and raw as I found them; and so hungry was I that at first
they seemed to me delicious.</p>

<p>3. Perhaps they were out of season, or perhaps there was
something wrong in the sea about my island. But at least I had no
sooner eaten my first meal than I was seized with giddiness and
retching, and lay for a long time no better than dead. A second
trial of the same food (indeed, I had no other) did better with me
and revived my strength.</p>

<p>4. But as long as I was on the island, I never knew what to
expect when I had eaten; sometimes all was <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>well, and sometimes I
was thrown into a miserable sickness; nor could I ever distinguish
what particular fish it was that hurt me. All day it streamed rain;
there was no dry spot to be found; and when I lay down that night,
between two boulders that made a kind of roof, my feet were in a
bog.</p>

<p>5. From a little up the hillside over the bay I could catch a
sight of the great ancient church and the roofs of the people's
houses in Iona. And on the other hand, over the low country of the
Ross, I saw smoke go up, morning and evening, as if from a
homestead in a hollow of the land.</p>

<p>6. I used to watch this smoke, when I was wet and cold and had
my head half-turned with loneliness, and think of the fireside and
of the company till my heart burned. Altogether, this sight I had
of men's homes and comfortable lives, although it put a point on my
own sufferings, yet it kept hope alive, and helped me to eat my raw
shellfish (which had soon grown to be a disgust), and saved me from
the sense of horror I had whenever I was quite alone with dead
rocks, and fowls, and the rain, and the cold sea.</p>

<p>7. Charles the Second declared a man could stay outdoors more
days in the year in the climate of England than in any other. That
was very like a king with a palace at his back and changes of dry
clothes. But he must have had better luck on his flight from
Worcester than I had on that miserable isle. It was the height of
summer; yet it rained for more than twenty-four hours, and did not
clear until the afternoon of the third day.</p>

<p>8. There is a pretty high rock on the north-west of Earraid,
which (because it had a flat top and overlooked the Sound) I was
much in the habit of frequenting; not <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>that I ever stayed in
one place, save when asleep, my misery giving me no rest. Indeed, I
wore myself down with continual and aimless goings and comings in
the rain.</p>

<p>9. As soon, however, as the sun came out, I lay down on the top
of that rock to dry myself. The comfort of the sunshine is a thing
I cannot tell. It set me thinking hopefully of my deliverance, of
which I had begun to despair; and I scanned the sea and the Ross
with a fresh interest. On the south of my rock a part of the island
jutted out and hid the open ocean so that a boat could thus come
quite near me upon that side and I be none the wiser.</p>

<p>10. Well, all of a sudden, a coble, with a brown sail and a pair
of fishers aboard of it, came flying round that corner of the isle,
bound for Iona. I shouted out, and then fell on my knees on the
rock and prayed to them. They were near enough to hear&mdash;I
could even see the colour of their hair&mdash;and there was no
doubt but they observed me, for they cried out in the Gaelic
tongue, and laughed. But the boat never turned aside, and flew
right on, before my eyes, for Iona.</p>

<p>11. I could not believe such wickedness, and ran along the shore
from rock to rock, crying on them piteously; even after they were
out of reach of my voice I still cried and waved to them; and when
they were quite gone I thought my heart would burst.</p>

<p>12. The next day (which was the fourth of this horrible life of
mine) I found my bodily strength run very low. But the sun shone,
the air was sweet, and what I managed to eat of the shellfish
agreed well with me and revived my courage.</p>

<p>13. I was scarce back on my rock (where I went <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>always
the first thing after I had eaten) before I observed a boat coming
down the Sound, and with her head, as I thought, in my
direction.</p>

<p>14. I began at once to hope and fear exceedingly; for I thought
these men might have thought better of their cruelty and be coming
back to my assistance. But another disappointment, such as
yesterday's, was more than I could bear. I turned my back
accordingly upon the sea, and did not look again till I had counted
many hundreds.</p>

<p>15. The boat was still heading for the island. The next time I
counted the full thousand, as slowly as I could, my heart beating
so as to hurt me. And then it was out of all question. She was
coming straight to Earraid. I could no longer hold myself back, but
ran to the seaside and out, from one rock to another, as far as I
could go. It is a marvel I was not drowned; for when I was brought
to a stand at last my legs shook under me, and my mouth was so dry
I must wet it with the sea water before I was able to shout.</p>

<p>16. All this time the boat was coming on; and now I was able to
perceive it was the same boat and the same two men as yesterday.
This I knew by their hair, which the one had of bright yellow and
the other black. But now there was a third man along with them, who
looked to be of a better class.</p>

<p>17. As soon as they were come within easy speech, they let down
their sail and lay quiet. In spite of my supplications, they drew
no nearer in, and what frightened me most of all, the new man
tee-heed with laughter as he talked and looked at me.</p>

<p>18. Then he stood up in the boat and addressed me a long while,
speaking fast and with many wavings of <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>his hand. I told him
I had no Gaelic; and at this he became very angry, and I began to
suspect he thought he was talking English. Listening very close, I
caught the word "whateffer" several times; but all the rest was
Gaelic, and might have been Greek and Hebrew for me.</p>

<p>19. "Whatever," said I, to show him I had caught a word. "Yes,
yes&mdash;yes, yes," said he; and then he looked at the other men
as much as to say, "I told you I spoke English," and began again as
hard as ever in the Gaelic.</p>

<p>20. This time I picked out another word, "tide." Then I had a
flash of hope. I remembered he was always waving his hand toward
the mainland of the Ross.</p>

<p>21. "Do you mean when the tide is out?"&mdash;I cried, and could
not finish.</p>

<p>22. "Yes, yes," said he. "Tide."</p>

<p>23. At that I turned tail upon their boat (where my adviser had
once more begun to tee-hee with laughter), leaped back the way I
had come, from one stone to another, and set off running across the
isle as I had never run before. In about half an hour I came upon
the shores of the creek, and, sure enough, it was shrunk into a
little trickle of water, through which I dashed, not above my
knees, and landed with a shout on the main island.</p>

<p>24. A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid, which
is only what they call a tidal islet, and, except, in the bottom of
the neaps, can be entered and left twice in every twenty-four
hours, either dry-shod, or, at the most, by wading. Even I, who had
seen the tide going out and in before me in the bay, and even
watched for the ebbs, the better to get my shellfish<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg
80]</a></span>&mdash;even I (I say), if I had sat down to think,
instead of raging at my fate, must have soon guessed the secret and
got free.</p>

<p>25. It was no wonder the fishers had not understood me. The
wonder was rather that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion,
and taken the trouble to come back. I had starved with cold and
hunger on that island for close upon one hundred hours. But for the
fishers, I might have left my bones there, in pure folly. And even
as it was, I had paid for it pretty dear, not only in past
sufferings but in my present case, being clothed like a beggar man,
scarce able to walk, and in great pain of my sore throat.</p>

<p>26. I have seen wicked men and fools&mdash;a great many of
both&mdash;and I believe they both get paid in the end; but the
fools first.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_81a" id="Page_81a"></a>BRIGGS IN LUCK</h3>

<p class="center2">From "Doctor Birch and his Young Friends"</p>

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Enter the Knife-boy.</i> Hamper for
Briggses!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Master Brown</i>. Hurray, Tom Briggs! I'll
lend you my knife.<br />
</small></p>

<p>If this story does not carry its own moral, what fable does, I
wonder? Before the arrival of that hamper, Master Briggs was in no
better repute than any other young gentleman of the lower school;
and in fact I had occasion myself, only lately, to correct Master
Brown for kicking his friend's shins during the writing-lesson. But
how this basket, directed by his mother's house-keeper, and marked
"GLASS WITH CARE," whence I concluded that it contained some jam
and some bottles <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id=
"Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>of wine probably, as well as the usual
cake and game-pie, and half a sovereign for the elder Master B.,
and five new shillings for Master Decimus Briggs&mdash;how, I say,
the arrival of this basket alters all Master Briggs's circumstances
in life, and the estimation in which many persons regard him!</p>

<p>If he is a good-hearted boy, as I have reason to think, the very
first thing he will do, before inspecting the contents of the
hamper, or cutting into them with the knife which Master Brown has
so considerately lent him, will be to read over the letter from
home which lies on top of the parcel. He does so, as I remarked to
Miss Raby (for whom I happened to be mending pens when the little
circumstance arose), with a flushed face and winking eyes. Look how
the other boys are peering into the basket as he reads&mdash;I say
to her, "Isn't it a pretty picture?" Part of the letter is in a
very large hand. That is from his little sister. And I would wager
that she netted the little purse which he has just taken out of it,
and which Master Lynx is eyeing.</p>

<p>"You are a droll man, and remark all sorts of queer things,"
Miss Raby says, smiling, and plying her swift needle and fingers as
quick as possible.</p>

<p>"I am glad we were both on the spot, and that the little fellow
lies under our guns as it were, and so is protected from some such
brutal school-pirate as young Duval for instance, who would rob
him, probably, of some of those good things; good in themselves,
and better because fresh from home. See, there is a pie as I said,
and which I daresay is better than those which are served at our
table (but you never take any notice of these kind of things, Miss
Raby), a cake, of course, a bottle of currant wine, jam-pots, and
no end of pears <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id=
"Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>in the straw. With this money little
Briggs will be able to pay the tick which that impudent child has
run up with Mrs. Ruggles; and I shall let Briggs Major pay for the
pencil-case which Bullock sold to him.&mdash;It will be a lesson to
the young prodigal for the future.</p>

<p>"But, I say, what a change there will be in his life for some
time to come, and at least until his present wealth is spent! The
boys who bully him will mollify toward him and accept his pie and
sweetmeats. They will have feasts in the bedroom; and that wine
will taste more deliciously to them than the best out of the
Doctor's cellar. The cronies will be invited. Young Master Wagg
will tell his most dreadful story and sing his best song for a
slice of that pie. What a jolly night they will have! When we go
the rounds at night, Mr. Prince and I will take care to make a
noise before we come to Briggs's room, so that the boys may have
time to put the light out, to push the things away, and to scud
into bed. Doctor Spry may be put in requisition the next
morning."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! you absurd creature," cries out Miss Raby, laughing;
and I lay down the twelfth pen very nicely mended.</p>

<p>"Yes; after luxury comes the doctor, I say; after extravagance,
a hole in the breeches pocket. To judge from his disposition,
Briggs Major will not be much better off a couple of days hence
than he is now, and, if I am not mistaken, will end life a poor
man. Brown will be kicking his shins before a week is over, depend
upon it. There are boys and men of all sorts, Miss R.&mdash;there
are selfish sneaks who hoard until the store they daren't use grows
mouldy&mdash;there are spendthrifts who fling away, parasites who
flatter and lick its shoes, and <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>snarling curs who hate and
envy good fortune."</p>

<p>I put down the last of the pens, brushing away with it the quill
chips from her desk first, and she looked at me with a kind,
wondering face. I brushed them away, clicked the pen-knife into my
pocket, made her a bow, and walked off&mdash;for the bell was
ringing for school.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_88a" id="Page_88a"></a>THE PRODIGAL SON</h3>

<div class="center2">Luke xv 11-32</div>

<p>A certain man had two sons: And the younger of them said to his
father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.
And he divided unto them his living.</p>

<p>And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his
substance with riotous living. And when he had spent all, there
arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. And
he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he
sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fain have
filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man
gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired
servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I
perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say
unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy
hired servants.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg
89]</a></span></p>

<p>And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and
fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him,
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no
more worthy to be called thy son. But the father said to his
servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a
ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: And bring hither the
fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry; For this my
son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And
they began to be merry.</p>

<p>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh
to the house, he heard musick and dancing. And he called one of the
servants, and asked what these things meant. And he said unto him,
Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf,
because he hath received him safe and sound. And he was angry, and
would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.
And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment; and
yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my
friends: But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured
thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I
have is thine. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad,
for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost,
and is found.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_108a" id="Page_108a"></a>THE SKY</h3>

<p class="center2">From "Modern Painters"</p>

<p>1. It is a strange thing how little in general people know about
the sky. It is the part of creation in which nature has done more
for the sake of pleasing man, more for the sole and evident purpose
of talking to him and teaching him, than in any other of her works,
and it is just the part in which we least attend to her.</p>

<p>2. There are not many of her other works in which some more
material or essential purpose than the mere pleasing of man is not
answered by every part of their organization; but every essential
purpose of the sky might, so far as we know, be answered, if once
in three days, or thereabouts, a great ugly black rain-cloud were
brought up over the blue, and everything well watered, and so all
left blue again till next time, with perhaps a film of morning and
evening mist for dew.</p>

<p>3. And instead of this, there is not a moment of any day of our
lives, when nature is not producing scene after scene, picture
after picture, glory after glory, and working still upon such
exquisite and constant principles <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>of the most perfect
beauty, that it is quite certain it is all done for us, and
intended for our perpetual pleasure. And every man, wherever
placed, however far from other sources of interest or of beauty,
has this doing for him constantly.</p>

<p>4. The noblest scenes of the earth can be seen and known but by
few; it is not intended that man should live always in the midst of
them, he injures them by his presence, he ceases to feel them if he
be always with them; but the sky is for all; bright as it is, it is
not "too bright, nor good, for human nature's daily food"; it is
fitted in all its functions for the perpetual comfort and exalting
of the heart, for the soothing it and purifying it from its dross
and dust. Sometimes gentle, sometimes capricious, sometimes awful,
never the same for two moments together; almost human in its
passions, almost spiritual in its tenderness, almost divine in its
infinity, its appeal to what is immortal in us, is as distinct, as
its ministry of chastisement or of blessing to what is mortal, is
essential.</p>

<p>5. And yet we never attend to it, we never make it a subject of
thought, but as it has to do with our animal sensations; we look
upon all by which it speaks to us more clearly than to brutes, upon
all which bears witness to the intention of the Supreme, that we
are to receive more from the covering vault than the light and the
dew which we share with the weed and the worm, only as a succession
of meaningless and monotonous accidents too common and too vain to
be worthy of a moment of watchfulness, or a glance of admiration.
If in our moments of utter idleness and insipidity, we turn to the
sky as a last resource, which of its phenomena do we speak of?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg
110]</a></span>6. One says it has been wet, and another it has been
windy, and another it has been warm. Who, among the whole
chattering crowd, can tell me of the forms and the precipices of
the chain of tall white mountains that girded the horizon at noon
yesterday? Who saw the narrow sunbeam that came out of the south,
and smote upon their summits until they melted and mouldered away
in a dust of blue rain? Who saw the dance of the dead clouds when
the sunlight left them last night, and the west wind blew them
before it like withered leaves?</p>

<p>7. All has passed, unregretted as unseen; or if the apathy be
ever shaken off, even for an instant, it is only by what is gross,
or what is extraordinary; and yet it is not in the broad and fierce
manifestations of the elemental energies, not in the clash of the
hail, nor the drift of the whirlwind, that the highest characters
of the sublime are developed. God is not in the earthquake, nor in
the fire, but in the still, small voice.</p>

<p>8. They are but the blunt and the low faculties of our nature,
which can only be addressed through lamp-black and lightning. It is
in quiet and subdued passages of unobtrusive majesty, the deep, and
the calm, and the perpetual,&mdash;that which must be sought ere it
is seen, and loved ere it is understood,&mdash;things which the
angels work out for us daily, and yet vary eternally, which are
never wanting, and never repeated, which are to be found always yet
each found but once; it is through these that the lesson of
devotion is chiefly taught, and the blessing of beauty given.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_121a" id="Page_121a"></a>THE FOUR-HORSE RACE</h3>

<p class="center2">From "Black Rock"</p>

<p>1. The great event of the day, however, was to be the four-horse
race, for which three teams were entered&mdash;one from the mines
driven by Nixon, Craig's friend, a citizens' team, and Sandy's. The
race was really between the miners' team and that from the woods,
for the citizens' team, though made up of speedy horses, had not
been driven much together, and knew neither their driver nor each
other. In the miners' team were four bays, very powerful, a trifle
heavy perhaps, but well matched, perfectly trained, and perfectly
handled by their driver. Sandy had his long rangy roans, and for
leaders, a pair of half-broken pinto bronchos. The pintos, caught
the summer before upon the Alberta prairies, were fleet as deer,
but wicked and uncertain. They were Baptiste's special care and
pride. If they would only run straight, there was little doubt that
they would carry the roans and themselves to glory; but one <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg
122]</a></span>could not tell the moment they might bolt or kick
things to pieces.</p>

<p>2. Being the only non-partisan in the crowd, I was asked to
referee. The race was about half a mile and return, the first and
last quarters being upon the ice. The course, after leaving the
ice, led up from the river by a long, easy slope to the level
above; and at the further end, curved somewhat sharply around the
Old Fort. The only condition attaching to the race was, that the
teams should start from the scratch, make the turn of the Fort, and
finish at the scratch. There were no vexing regulations as to
fouls. The man making the foul would find it necessary to reckon
with the crowd, which was considered sufficient guarantee for a
fair and square race. Owing to the hazards of the course, the
result would depend upon the skill of the drivers quite as much as
the speed of the teams. The points of hazard were at the turn round
the Old Fort, and at a little ravine which led down to the river,
over which the road passed by means of a long, log bridge or
causeway.</p>

<p>3. From a point upon the high bank of the river, the whole
course lay in open view. It was a scene full of life and vividly
picturesque. There were miners in dark clothes and peak caps;
citizens in ordinary garb; ranch-men in wide cowboy hats and
buckskin shirts and leggings, some with cartridge-belts and
pistols; a few half-breeds and Indians in half-native,
half-civilized dress; and scattering through the crowd, the
lumbermen with gay scarlet and blue blanket coats, and some with
knitted tuques of the same colour. A very good-natured but
extremely uncertain crowd it was. At the head of each horse stood a
man, but at the pintos' heads Baptiste stood alone, trying to hold
down the off-leader, thrown <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>into a frenzy of fear
by the yelling of the crowd.</p>

<p>4. Gradually all became quiet, till, in the midst of absolute
stillness, came the words: "Are you ready?" then the pistol-shot,
and the great race had begun. Above the roar of the crowd came the
shrill cry of Baptiste, as he struck his broncho with the palm of
his hand, and swung himself into the sleigh beside Sandy, as it
shot past.</p>

<p>5. Like a flash the bronchos sprang to the front, two lengths
before the other teams; but, terrified by the yelling of the crowd,
instead of bending to the left bank up which the road wound, they
wheeled to the right and were almost across the river before Sandy
could swing them back into the course.</p>

<p>6. Baptiste's cries, a curious mixture of French and English,
continued to strike through all other sounds, till they gained the
top of the slope to find the others almost a hundred yards in
front, the citizens' team leading, with the miners' following
close. The moment the pintos caught sight of the teams before them,
they set off at a terrific pace and steadily devoured the
intervening space. Nearer and nearer the turn came, the eight
horses in front, running straight and well within their speed.
After them flew the pintos, running savagely with ears set back,
leading well the big roans, thundering along and gaining at every
bound. And now the citizens' team had almost reached the Fort,
running hard and drawing away from the bays. But Nixon knew what he
was about, and was simply steadying his team for the turn. The
event proved his wisdom, for in the turn the leading team left the
track, lost a moment or two in the deep snow, and before they could
regain the road, the bays had swept superbly past, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg
124]</a></span>leaving their rivals to follow in the rear. On came
the pintos, swiftly nearing the Fort. Surely at that pace they
cannot make the turn. But Sandy knows his leaders. They have their
eyes upon the teams in front, and need no touch of rein. Without
the slightest change in speed the nimble-footed bronchos round the
turn, hauling the big roans after them, and fall in behind the
citizens' team, which is regaining steadily the ground lost in the
turn.</p>

<p>7. And now the struggle is for the bridge over the ravine. The
bays in front, running with mouths wide open, are evidently doing
their best; behind them, and every moment nearing them, but at the
limit of their speed too, come the lighter and fleeter citizens'
team; while opposite their driver are the pintos, pulling hard,
eager and fresh. Their temper is too uncertain to send them to the
front; they run well following, but when leading cannot be trusted,
and besides, a broncho hates a bridge; so Sandy holds them where
they are, waiting and hoping for his chance after the bridge is
crossed. Foot by foot the citizens' team creep up upon the flank of
the bays, with the pintos in turn hugging them closely, till it
seems as if the three, if none slackens, must strike the bridge
together; and this will mean destruction to one at least. This
danger Sandy perceives, but he dare not check his leaders.
Suddenly, within a few yards of the bridge, Baptiste throws himself
upon the lines, wrenches them out of Sandy's hands, and, with a
quick swing, forces the pintos down the steep side of the ravine,
which is almost sheer ice with a thin coat of snow. It is a daring
course to take, for the ravine, though not deep, is full of
undergrowth, and is partially closed up by a brush heap at the
further end. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id=
"Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>But with a yell, Baptiste hurls his
four horses down the slope, and into the undergrowth. "Allons, mes
enfants! Courage! vite, vite!" cries their driver, and nobly do the
pintos respond. Regardless of bushes and brush heaps, they tear
their way through; but as they emerge, the hind bob-sleigh catches
a root, and, with a crash, the sleigh is hurled high into the air.
Baptiste's cries ring out high and shrill as ever, encouraging his
team, and never cease till, with a plunge and a scramble, they
clear the brush heap lying at the mouth of the ravine, and are out
on the ice on the river, with Baptiste standing on the front bob,
the box trailing behind, and Sandy nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>8. Three hundred yards of the course remain. The bays, perfectly
handled, have gained at the bridge, and in the descent to the ice,
and are leading the citizens' team by half a dozen sleigh lengths.
Behind both comes Baptiste. It is now or never for the pintos. The
rattle of the trailing box, together with the wild yelling of the
crowd rushing down the bank, excites the bronchos to madness, and,
taking the bits in their teeth, they do their first free running
that day. Past the citizens' team like a whirlwind they dash, clear
the intervening space, and gain the flanks of the bays. Can the
bays hold them? Over them leans their driver, plying for the first
time the hissing lash. Only fifty yards more. The miners begin to
yell. But Baptiste, waving his lines high in one hand, seizes his
tuque with the other, whirls it above his head and flings it with a
fiercer yell than ever at the bronchos. Like the bursting of a
hurricane the pintos leap forward, and with a splendid rush cross
the scratch, winners by their own length.</p>

ought to know that as both always wear off, 'tis safest in
matrimony to begin with a little aversion. I am sure I hated your
poor dear uncle before marriage as if he'd been a blackamoor; and
yet, miss, you are sensible what a wife I made? and when it pleased
Heaven to release me from him, 'tis unknown what tears I shed! But
suppose we were going to give you another choice, will you promise
us to give up this Beverley?</p>

<p><i>Lydia</i>.&mdash;Could I belie my thoughts so far as to give
that promise, my actions would certainly as far belie my words.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>.&mdash;Take yourself to your room. You are
fit company for nothing but your own ill-humours.</p>

<p><i>Lydia</i>.&mdash;Willingly, ma'am&mdash;I cannot change for
the worse.<span class='pagenum2'>(<i>Exit</i>)</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>.&mdash;There's a little intricate hussy for
you!</p>

<p><i>Sir Anthony</i>.&mdash;It is not to be wondered at, ma'am:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg
128]</a></span>all this is the natural consequence of teaching
girls to read. Had I a thousand daughters, by heaven I'd as soon
have them taught the black art as their alphabet!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>.&mdash;Nay, nay, Sir Anthony: you are an
absolute misanthropy.</p>

<p><i>Sir Anthony</i>.&mdash;In my way hither, Mrs. Malaprop, I
observed your niece's maid coming forth from a circulating library!
She had a book in each hand; they were half-bound volumes with
marble covers! From that moment I guessed how full of duty I should
see her mistress!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>.&mdash;Those are vile places indeed!</p>

<p><i>Sir Anthony</i>.&mdash;Madam, a circulating library in a town
is an evergreen tree of diabolical knowledge,&mdash;it blossoms
through the year! And depend on it, Mrs. Malaprop, that they who
are so fond of handling the leaves will long for the fruit at
last.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>.&mdash;Fy, fy, Sir Anthony! you surely
speak laconically.</p>

<p><i>Sir Anthony</i>.&mdash;Why, Mrs. Malaprop, in moderation now,
what would you have a woman know?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>.&mdash;Observe me, Sir Anthony. I would by
no means wish a daughter of mine to be a progeny of learning; I
don't think so much learning becomes a young woman: for instance, I
would never let her meddle with Greek, or Hebrew, or algebra, or
simony, or fluxions, or paradoxes, or such inflammatory branches of
learning; neither would it be necessary for her to handle any of
your mathematical, astronomical, diabolical instruments. But, Sir
Anthony, I would send her at nine years old to a boarding-school,
in order to learn a little ingenuity and artifice. Then, sir, she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg
129]</a></span>should have a supercilious knowledge in accounts;
and as she grew up I would have her instructed in geometry, that
she might know something of the contagious countries: but above
all, Sir Anthony, she should be mistress of orthodoxy, that she
might not misspell and mispronounce words so shamefully as girls
usually do; and likewise that she might reprehend the true meaning
of what she is saying. This, Sir Anthony, is what I would have a
woman know; and I don't think there is a superstitious article in
it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Anthony</i>.&mdash;Well, well, Mrs. Malaprop, I will
dispute the point no further with you; though I must confess that
you are a truly moderate and polite arguer, for almost every third
word you say is on my side of the question. But, Mrs. Malaprop, to
the more important point in debate: you say you have no objection
to my proposal?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>.&mdash;None, I assure you. I am under no
positive engagement with Mr. Acres; and as Lydia is so obstinate
against him, perhaps your son may have better success.</p>

<p><i>Sir Anthony</i>.&mdash;Well, madam, I will write for the boy
directly. He knows not a syllable of this yet, though I have for
some time had the proposal in my head. He is at present with his
regiment.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>.&mdash;We have never seen your son, Sir
Anthony; but I hope no objection on his side.</p>

<p><i>Sir Anthony</i>.&mdash;Objection! let him object if he dare!
No, no, Mrs. Malaprop, Jack knows that the least demur puts me in a
frenzy directly. My process was always very simple: in their
younger days, 'twas "Jack, do this"; if he demurred I knocked him
down, and if he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id=
"Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>grumbled at that I always sent him
out of the room.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>.&mdash;Ay, and the properest way, o'my
conscience! Nothing is so conciliating to young people as severity.
Well, Sir Anthony, I shall give Mr. Acres his discharge, and
prepare Lydia to receive your son's invocations; and I hope you
will represent her to the captain as an object not altogether
illegible.</p>

<p><i>Sir Anthony</i>.&mdash;Madam, I will handle the subject
prudently. Well I must leave you; and let me beg you, Mrs.
Malaprop, to enforce this matter roundly to the girl. Take my
advice&mdash;keep a tight hand: if she rejects this proposal, clap
her under lock and key; and if you were just to let the servants
forget to bring her dinner for three or four days, you can't
conceive how she'd come about.<span class=
"pagenum2">(<i>Exit</i>)</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>.&mdash;Well, at any rate I shall be glad to
get her from under my intuition. She has somehow discovered my
partiality for Sir Lucius O'Trigger: sure Lucy can't have betrayed
me! No, the girl is such a simpleton, I should have made her
confess it. (Calls) Lucy! Lucy!&mdash;Had she been one of your
artificial ones, I should never have trusted her.</p>

<h3>THE GLOVE AND THE LIONS</h3>

<div class="poem0">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">King Francis was a hearty
king, and lov'd a royal sport,</span> <span class="i0">And one day,
as his lions strove, sat looking on the court;</span> <span class=

king above, and the royal beasts below.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ramp'd and roar'd the lions, with horrid laughing

like beams, a wind went with their paws;</span> <span class=

me!</span> <span class="i0">King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the

glove to prove his love; great glory will be mine!"</span><br />
<span class="i0">She dropp'd her glove to prove his love: then
looked on him and smiled;</span> <span class="i0">He bow'd, and in
a moment leap'd among the lions wild:<span class=

return was quick; he soon regain'd his place;</span> <span class=

<h3>SIR PETER AND LADY TEAZLE</h3>

<p class="center2">From "The School for Scandal"</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;Lady Teazle, Lady Teazle, I'll not bear
it!</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;Sir Peter, Sir Peter, you may bear it
or not, as you please; but I ought to have my own way in
everything, and, what's more, I will, too. What though I was
educated in the country, I know very well that women of fashion in
London are accountable to nobody after they are married.</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;Very well, ma'am, very well; so a
husband is to have no influence, no authority?</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;Authority! No, to be sure: if you
wanted authority over me, you should have adopted me and not
married me: I am sure you were old enough.</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;Old enough!&mdash;ay, there it is. Well,
well, Lady Teazle, though my life may be made unhappy by your
temper, I'll not be ruined by your extravagance!</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;My extravagance! I'm sure I'm not more
extravagant than a woman of fashion ought to be.</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;No, no, madam, you shall throw away no
more sums on such unmeaning luxury. To spend as much to furnish
your dressing room with flowers in winter as would suffice to turn
the Pantheon into a greenhouse, and give a f&ecirc;te
champ&ecirc;tre at Christmas!</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;And am I to blame, Sir Peter, because
flowers are dear in cold weather? You should find fault with the
climate, and not with me. For my <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>part, I'm sure I wish
it was spring all the year round, and that roses grew under our
feet!</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;Oons! madam&mdash;if you had been born
to this, I shouldn't wonder at your talking thus; but you forget
what your situation was when I married you.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;No, no, I don't; 'twas a very
disagreeable one, or I should never have married you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;Yes, yes, madam, you were then in
somewhat a humbler style&mdash;the daughter of a plain country
squire. Recollect, Lady Teazle, when I saw you first sitting at
your tambour, in a pretty figured linen gown, with a bunch of keys
at your side, your hair combed smooth over a roll, and your
apartment hung round with fruits in worsted, of your own
working.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;Oh, yes! I remember it very well, and
a curious life I led. My daily occupation to inspect the dairy,
superintend the poultry, make extracts from the family receipt
book, and comb my aunt Deborah's lap-dog.</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;Yes, yes, ma'am, 'twas so indeed.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;And then, you know, my evening
amusements! To draw patterns for ruffles, which I had not materials
to make up; to play Pope Joan with the curate; to read a sermon to
my aunt; or to be stuck down to an old spinet to strum my father to
sleep after a fox chase.</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;I am glad you have so good a memory.
Yes, madam, these were the recreations I took you from; but now you
must have your coach&mdash;<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>&mdash;and three
powdered footmen before your chair; and, in the summer, a pair of
white cats to draw you to Kensington Gardens. No recollection, I
suppose, when you were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id=
"Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>content to ride double, behind the
butler, on a docked coach horse.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;No&mdash;I swear I never did that: I
deny the butler and the coach horse.</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;This, madam, was your situation; and
what have I done for you? I have made you a woman of fashion, of
fortune, of rank,&mdash;in short, I have made you my wife.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;Well, then, and there is but one thing
more you can make me to add to the obligation, that is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;My widow, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;Hem! hem!</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;I thank you, madam&mdash;but don't
flatter yourself, for, though your ill conduct may disturb my peace
of mind, it shall never break my heart, I promise you: however, I
am equally obliged to you for the hint.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;Then why will you endeavour to make
yourself so disagreeable to me, and thwart me in every little
elegant expense.</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;Oons! madam, I say, had you any of these
little elegant expenses when you married me?</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;Lud, Sir Peter! would you have me be
out of the fashion?</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;The fashion, indeed! what had you to do
with the fashion before you married me?</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;For my part, I should think you would
like to have your wife thought a woman of taste.</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;Ay&mdash;there again&mdash;taste!
Zounds! madam, you had no taste when you married me!</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;That's very true, indeed, Sir Peter!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg
139]</a></span>and, after having married you, I should never
pretend to taste again, I allow. But now, Sir Peter, since we have
finished our daily jangle, I presume I may go to my engagement at
Lady Sneerwell's.</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;Ay, there's another precious
circumstance&mdash;a charming set of acquaintance you have made
there.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;Nay, Sir Peter, they are all people of
rank and fortune, and remarkably tenacious of reputation.</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;Yes, they are tenacious of reputation
with a vengeance; for they don't choose anybody should have a
character but themselves! Such a crew! Ah! many a wretch has rid on
a hurdle who has done less mischief than these utterers of forged
tales, coiners of scandal, and clippers of reputation.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teazle</i>.&mdash;What! would you restrain the freedom
of speech?</p>

<p><i>Sir Peter</i>.&mdash;Ah! they have made you just as bad as

<h3><a name="Page_145a" id="Page_145a"></a>FROM THE "APOLOGY" OF
SOCRATES</h3>

<p class="center2">From "The Dialogues of Plato"</p>

<p>1. Not much time will be gained, O Athenians, in return for the
evil name which you will get from the detractors of the city, who
will say that you killed Socrates, a wise man; for they will call
me wise, even although I am not wise, when they want to reproach
you. If you had waited a little while, your desire would have been
fulfilled in the course of nature. For I am far advanced in years,
as you may perceive, and not far from death. I am speaking now only
to those of you who have condemned me to death. And I have another
thing to say to them: You think that I was convicted through
deficiency of words&mdash;I mean, that if I had thought fit to
leave nothing undone, nothing unsaid, I might have gained an
acquittal. Not so; the deficiency <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>which led to my
conviction was not of words&mdash;certainly not. But I had not the
boldness or impudence or inclination to address you as you would
have liked me to address you, weeping and wailing and lamenting,
and saying and doing many things which you have been accustomed to
hear from others, and which, as I say, are unworthy of me. But I
thought that I ought not to do anything common or mean in the hour
of danger; nor do I now repent of the manner of my defence, and I
would rather die having spoken after my manner, than speak in your
manner and live. For neither in war nor yet at law ought any man to
use every way of escaping death. For often in battle there is no
doubt that if a man will throw away his arms, and fall on his knees
before his pursuers, he may escape death; and in other dangers
there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing to say
and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding
death, but in avoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than
death. I am old and move slowly, and the slower runner has
overtaken me, and my accusers are keen and quick, and the faster
runner, who is unrighteousness, has overtaken them. And now I
depart hence, condemned by you to suffer the penalty of death, and
they too go their ways, condemned by the truth to suffer the
penalty of villainy and wrong; and I must abide by my
reward&mdash;let them abide by theirs. I suppose that these things
may be regarded as fated,&mdash;and I think that they are well.</p>

<p>2. And now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy
to you; for I am about to die, and that is the hour in which men
are gifted with prophetic power. And I prophesy to you who are my
murderers, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id=
"Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>that immediately after my death
punishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will surely
await you. Me you have killed because you wanted to escape the
accuser, and not to give an account of your lives. But that will
not be as you suppose: far otherwise. For I say that there will be
more accusers of you than there are now; accusers whom hitherto I
have restrained: and as they are younger they will be more severe
with you, and you will be more offended at them. For if you think
that by killing men you can avoid the accuser censuring your lives,
you are mistaken; that is not a way of escape which is either
possible or honourable; the easiest and the noblest way is not to
be crushing others, but to be improving yourselves. This is the
prophecy which I utter before my departure to the judges who have
condemned me.</p>

<p>3. Friends, who would have acquitted me, I would like also to
talk with you about this thing which has happened, while the
magistrates are busy, and before I go to the place at which I must
die. Stay then a while, for we may as well talk with one another
while there is time. You are my friends, and I should like to show
you the meaning of this event which has happened to me. O my
judges&mdash;for you I may truly call judges&mdash;I should like to
tell you of a wonderful circumstance. Hitherto the familiar oracle
within me has constantly been in the habit of opposing me even
about trifles, if I was going to make a slip or error about
anything; and now, as you see, there has come upon me that which
may be thought, and is generally believed to be, the last and worst
evil. But the oracle made no sign of opposition, either as I was
leaving my house and going out in the morning, or when I was going
up into this court, or while I was <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>speaking, at anything
which I was going to say; and yet I have often been stopped in the
middle of a speech, but now in nothing I either said or did
touching this matter has the oracle opposed me. What do I take to
be the explanation of this? I will tell you. I regard this as a
proof that what has happened to me is a good, and that those of us
who think that death is an evil are in error. This is a great proof
to me of what I am saying, for the customary sign would surely have
opposed me had I been going to evil and not to good.</p>

<p>4. Let us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is
a great reason to hope that death is a good, for one of two things:
either death is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness,
or, as men say, there is a change and migration of the soul from
this world to another. Now if you suppose that there is no
consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed
even by the sight of dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. For
if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was
undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the other
days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days
and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more
pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a
private man, but even the great king will not find many such days
or nights, when compared with the others. Now if death is like
this, I say that to die is gain; for eternity is then only a single
night. But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as
men say, all the dead are, what good, O my friends and judges, can
be greater than this? If indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the
world below, he is delivered from the professors of justice in this
world, and finds the true <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149"
id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>judges who are said to give
judgment there, Minos and Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus, and
Triptolemus, and other sons of God who were righteous in their own
life, that pilgrimage will be worth making. What would not a man
give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and
Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again. I, too,
shall have a wonderful interest in a place where I can converse
with Palamedes, and Ajax the son of Telamon, and other heroes of
old, who have suffered death through an unjust judgment; and there
will be no small pleasure, as I think, in comparing my own
sufferings with theirs. Above all, I shall be able to continue my
search into true and false knowledge; as in this world, so also in
that; I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise and
is not. What would not a man give, O judges, to be able to examine
the leader of the great Trojan expedition; or Odysseus, or
Sisyphus, or numberless others, men and women too! What infinite
delight would there be in conversing with them and asking them
questions! For in that world they do not put a man to death for
this; certainly not. For besides being happier in that world than
in this, they will be immortal, if what is said is true.</p>

<p>5. Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know
this of a truth&mdash;that no evil can happen to a good man, either
in life or after death. He and his are not neglected by the gods;
nor has my own approaching end happened by mere chance. But I see
clearly that to die and be released was better for me; and
therefore the oracle gave no sign. For which reason, also, I am not
angry with my accusers or my condemners; they have done me no harm,
although neither of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id=
"Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>them meant to do me any good; and for
this I may gently blame them.</p>

<p>6. Still I have a favour to ask of them. When my sons are grown
up, I would ask you, O my friends, to punish them and I would have
you trouble them, as I have troubled you, if they seem to care
about riches, or anything, more than about virtue; or if they
pretend to be something when they are really nothing,&mdash;then
reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring about that for
which they ought to care, and thinking that they are something when
they are really nothing. And if you do this, I and my sons will
have received justice at your hands.</p>

<p>7. The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways&mdash;I
to die, and you to live. Which is better God only knows.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_157a" id="Page_157a"></a>OF STUDIES</h3>

<p class="center2">From the "Essays"</p>

<p>Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their
chief use for delight, is in privateness and retiring; for
ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment and
disposition of business. For expert men can execute, and perhaps
judge of particulars, one by one; but the general counsels, and the
plots, and marshalling of affairs, come best from those that are
learned.</p>

<p>To spend too much time in studies, is sloth; to use them too
much for ornament, is affectation; to make judgment wholly by their
rules, is the humour of a scholar. They perfect nature and are
perfected by experience: for natural abilities are like natural
plants, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg
158]</a></span>that need pruning by study; and studies themselves
do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded
in by experience.</p>

<p>Crafty men contemn studies; simple men admire them; and wise men
use them; for they teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom
without them, and above them, won by observation. Read not to
contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to
find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider.</p>

<p>Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some
few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read
only in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few
to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention. Some books
also may be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others;
but that would be only in the less important arguments, and the
meaner sort of books; else distilled books are like common
distilled waters, flashy things.</p>

<p>Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing
an exact man. And therefore, if a man write little, he had need
have a good memory, if he confer little, he had need have a present
wit; and if he read little, he had need have much cunning, to seem
to know that he doth not.</p>

<p>If a man's wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics; for
in demonstrations, if his wit be called away never so little, he
must begin again; if his wits be not apt to distinguish or find
differences, let him study the schoolmen; if he be not apt to beat
over matters, and to call up one thing to prove and illustrate
another, let him study the lawyers' cases. So every defect of the
mind may have a special receipt.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_159a" id="Page_159a"></a>THE INFLUENCE OF
ATHENS</h3>

<p class="center2">From essay "On Mitford's History of Greece"</p>

<p>If we consider merely the subtlety of disquisition, the force of
imagination, the perfect energy and elegance of expression, which
characterize the great works of Athenian genius, we must pronounce
them intrinsically most valuable. But what shall we say when we
reflect that from hence have sprung, directly or indirectly, all
the noblest creations of the human intellect; that from hence were
the vast accomplishments and the brilliant fancy of Cicero, the
withering fire of Juvenal, the plastic imagination of Dante, the
humour of Cervantes, the comprehension of Bacon, the wit of Butler,
the supreme and universal excellence of Shakespeare?</p>

<p>All the triumphs of truth and genius over prejudice and power,
in every country and in every age, have been the triumphs of
Athens. Wherever a few great minds have made a stand against
violence and fraud, in the cause of liberty and reason, there has
been her spirit in the midst of them; inspiring, encouraging,
consoling;&mdash;by the lonely lamp of Erasmus, by the restless bed
of Pascal, in the tribune of Mirabeau, in the cell of Galileo, on
the scaffold of Sidney.</p>

<p>But who shall estimate her influence on private happiness? Who
shall say how many thousands have been <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>made wiser,
happier, and better, by those pursuits in which she has taught
mankind to engage; to how many the studies which took their rise
from her have been wealth in poverty, liberty in bondage, health in
sickness, society in solitude?</p>

<p>Her power is, indeed, manifested at the bar, in the senate, in
the field of battle, in the schools of philosophy. But these are
not her glory. Wherever literature consoles sorrow, or assuages
pain; wherever it brings gladness to eyes which fail with
wakefulness and tears, and ache for the dark house and the long
sleep,&mdash;there is exhibited, in its noblest form, the immortal
influence of Athens.</p>

<p>The dervish, in the Arabian tale, did not hesitate to abandon to
his comrade the camels with their loads of jewels and gold, while
he retained the casket of that mysterious juice which enabled him
to behold at one glance all the hidden riches of the universe.
Surely it is no exaggeration to say that no external advantage is
to be compared with that purification of the intellectual eye which
gives us to contemplate the infinite wealth of the mental world,
all the hoarded treasures of its primeval dynasties, all the
shapeless ore of its yet unexplored mines. This is the gift of
Athens to man.</p>

<p>Her freedom and her power have, for more than twenty centuries,
been annihilated; her people have degenerated into timid slaves;
her language, into a barbarous jargon; her temples have been given
up to the successive depredations of Romans, Turks, and Scotchmen;
but her intellectual empire is imperishable.</p>

<p>And when those who have rivalled her greatness shall have shared
her fate; when civilization and know<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ledge shall have fixed
their abode in distant continents; when the sceptre shall have
passed away from England; when, perhaps, travellers from distant
regions shall in vain labour to decipher on some mouldering
pedestal the name of our proudest chief, shall hear savage hymns
chaunted to some misshapen idol over the ruined dome of our
proudest temple, and shall see a single naked fisherman wash his
nets in the river of the ten thousand masts,&mdash;her influence
and her glory will still survive,&mdash;fresh in eternal youth,
exempt from mutability and decay, immortal as the intellectual
principle from which they derived their origin, and over which they
exercise their control.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_161a" id="Page_161a"></a>NATIONAL MORALITY</h3>

<p>1. I believe there is no permanent greatness to a nation except
it be based upon morality. I do not care for military greatness or
military renown. I care for the condition of the people among whom
I live. There is no man in England who is less likely to speak
irreverently of the Crown and Monarchy of England than I am; but
crowns, coronets, mitres, military display, the pomp of war, wide
colonies, and a huge empire, are, in my view, all trifles light as
air, and not worth considering, unless with them you can have a
fair share of comfort, contentment, and happiness, among the great
body of the people. Palaces, baronial castles, great halls, stately
mansions, do not make a nation. <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>The nation in every
country dwells in the cottage; and unless the light of your
Constitution can shine there, unless the beauty of your legislation
and the excellence of your statesmanship are impressed there on the
feelings and condition of the people, rely upon it, you have yet to
learn the duties of government.</p>

<p>2. I have not pleaded, as you have observed, that this country
should remain without adequate and scientific means of defence. I
acknowledge it to be the duty of your statesmen, acting upon the
known opinions and principles of ninety-nine out of every one
hundred persons in the country, at all times, with all possible
moderation, but with all possible efficiency, to take steps which
shall preserve order within and on the confines of your kingdom.
But I shall repudiate and denounce the expenditure of every
shilling, the engagement of every man, the employment of every ship
which has no object but intermeddling in the affairs of other
countries and endeavouring to extend the boundaries of an Empire
which is already large enough to satisfy the greatest ambition, and
I fear is much too large for the highest statesmanship to which any
man has yet attained.</p>

<p>3. The most ancient of profane historians has told us that the
Scythians of his time were a very warlike people, and that they
elevated an old scimitar upon a platform as a symbol of Mars, for
to Mars alone, I believe, they built altars and offered sacrifices.
To this scimitar they offered sacrifices of horses and cattle, the
main wealth of the country, and more costly sacrifices than to all
the rest of their gods. I often ask myself whether we are at all
advanced in one respect beyond those Scythians. What are our
contributions to charity, to education, to morality, to religion,
to justice, and to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id=
"Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>civil government, when compared with
the wealth we expend in sacrifices to the old scimitar?</p>

<p>4. Two nights ago I addressed in this hall a vast assembly
composed to a great extent of your countrymen, who have no
political power, who are at work from the dawn of the day to the
evening, and who have therefore limited means of informing
themselves on these great subjects. Now I am privileged to speak to
a somewhat different audience. You represent those of your great
community who have a more complete education, who have on some
points greater intelligence, and in whose hands reside the power
and influence of the district. I am speaking, too, within the
hearing of those whose gentle nature, whose finer instincts, whose
purer minds, have not suffered as some of us have suffered in the
turmoil and strife of life. You can mould opinion, you can create
political power,&mdash;you cannot think a good thought on this
subject and communicate it to your neighbours,&mdash;you cannot
make these points topics of discussion in your social circles and
more general meetings, without affecting sensibly and speedily the
course which the government of your country will pursue. May I ask
you, then, to believe, as I do most devoutly believe, that the
moral law was not written for men alone in their individual
character, but that it was written as well for nations, and for
nations great as this of which we are citizens. If nations reject

enough. We know what the past has cost us, we know how much and how
far we have wandered, but we are not left without a guide. It is
true, we have not, as an ancient people had, Urim and
Thummin&mdash;those oraculous gems in Aaron's breast&mdash;from
which to take counsel, but we have the unchangeable and eternal
principles of the moral law to guide us, and only so far as we walk
by that guidance can we be permanently a great nation, or our
people a happy people.</p>

<h3>CRANFORD SOCIETY</h3>

<p class="center2">From "Cranford"</p>

<p>In the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons;
all the holders of houses above a certain rent are women. If a
married couple come to settle in the town, somehow the gentleman
disappears; he is either fairly frightened to death by being the
only man in the Cranford evening parties, or he is accounted for by
being with his regiment, his ship, or closely engaged in business
all the week in the great neighbouring commercial town of Drumble,
distant only twenty miles on a railway. In short, whatever does
become of the gentlemen, they are not at Cranford. What could they
do if they were there? The surgeon has his round of thirty miles,
and sleeps at Cranford; but every man cannot be a surgeon. For
keeping the trim gardens full of choice flowers without a weed to
speck them; for frightening away little boys who look wistfully at
the said flowers through the railings; for rushing out at the geese
that occasionally venture into the gardens if the gates are left
open; for deciding all questions of literature and politics without
troubling themselves with unnecessary reasons or arguments; for
obtaining clear and correct knowledge of everybody's affairs in the
parish; for keeping their neat maidservants in admirable order; for
kindness (somewhat dictatorial) to the poor, and real tender good
offices to each other whenever they are in distress&mdash;the
ladies of Cranford are quite sufficient. "A man," as one of them
observed to me once, "is <i>so</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>in the way in the
house!" Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other's
proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other's
opinions. Indeed, as each has her own individuality, not to say
eccentricity, pretty strongly developed, nothing is so easy as
verbal retaliation; but, somehow, good-will reigns among them to a
considerable degree.</p>

<p>Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls;
and they were announced to any young people who might be staying in
the town, with all the solemnity with which the old Manx laws were
read once a year on the Tinwald Mount.</p>

<p>"Our friends have sent to inquire how you are after your journey
to-night, my dear" (fifteen miles in a gentleman's carriage). "They
will give you some rest to-morrow; but the next day, I have no
doubt, they will call; so be at liberty after twelve&mdash;from
twelve to three are our calling hours."</p>

<p>Then, after they had called&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the third day, I dare say your mamma has told you, my
dear, never to let more than three days elapse between receiving a
call and returning it; and also, that you are never to stay longer
than a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"But am I to look at my watch? How am I to find out when a
quarter of an hour has passed?"</p>

<p>"You must keep thinking about the time, my dear, and not allow
yourself to forget it in conversation."</p>

<p>As everybody had this rule in their minds, whether they received
or paid a call, of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken
about. We kept ourselves to short sentences of small talk, and were
punctual to our time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg
180]</a></span></p>

<p>I imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of Cranford were poor,
and had some difficulty in making both ends meet; but they were
like the Spartans, and concealed their smart under a smiling face.
We none of us spoke of money, because that subject savoured of
commerce and trade; and though some might be poor, we were all
aristocratic. The Cranfordians had that kindly <i>esprit de
corps</i> which made them overlook all deficiencies in success when
some among them tried to conceal their poverty. When Mrs.
Forrester, for instance, gave a party in her baby-house of a
dwelling, and the little maiden disturbed the ladies on the sofa by
a request that she might get the tea-tray out from underneath,
every one took this novel proceeding as the most natural thing in
the world, and talked on about household forms and ceremonies as if
we all believed that our hostess had a regular servants' hall,
second table, with house-keeper and steward, instead of the one
little charity-school maiden, whose short ruddy arms could never
have been strong enough to carry the tray upstairs, if she had not
been assisted in private by her mistress, who now sat in state,
pretending not to know what cakes were sent up, though she knew,
and we knew, and she knew that we knew, and we knew that she knew
that we knew, she had been busy all morning making tea-bread and
sponge-cakes.</p>

<p>There were one or two consequences arising from this general but
unacknowledged poverty, and this very much acknowledged gentility,
which were not amiss, and which might be introduced into many
circles of society to their great improvement. For instance, the
inhabitants of Cranford kept early hours, and clattered home <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg
181]</a></span>in their pattens, under the guidance of a
lantern-bearer, about nine o'clock at night; and the whole town was
abed and asleep by half-past ten. Moreover, it was considered
"vulgar" (a tremendous word in Crawford) to give anything
expensive, in the way of eatable or drinkable, at the evening
entertainments. Wafer bread-and-butter and sponge-biscuits were all
that the Honourable Mrs. Jamieson gave; and she was sister-in-law
to the late Earl of Glenmire, although she did practise such
"elegant economy."</p>

<p>"Elegant economy!" How naturally one falls back into the
phraseology of Cranford! There, economy was always "elegant," and
money-spending always "vulgar and ostentatious;" a sort of
sour-grapeism which made us very peaceful and satisfied. I never
shall forget the dismay felt when a certain Captain Brown came to
live at Cranford, and openly spoke about his being poor&mdash;not
in a whisper to an intimate friend, the doors and windows being
previously closed, but in the public street, in a loud military
voice, alleging his poverty as a reason for not taking a particular
house. The ladies of Cranford were already rather moaning over the
invasion of their territories by a man and a gentleman. He was a
half-pay captain, and had obtained some situation on a neighbouring
railway, which had been vehemently petitioned against by the little
town; and if, in addition to his masculine gender, and his
connection with the obnoxious railway, he was so brazen as to talk
of being poor&mdash;why, then, indeed, he must be sent to Coventry.
Death was as true and as common as poverty; yet people never spoke
about that loud out in the streets. It was a word not to be
mentioned to ears <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id=
"Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>polite. We had tacitly agreed to
ignore that any with whom we associated on terms of visiting
equality could ever be prevented by poverty from doing anything
that they wished. If we walked to or from a party, it was because
the night was <i>so</i> fine, or the air <i>so</i> refreshing, not
because sedan-chairs were expensive. If we wore prints instead of
summer silks, it was because we preferred a washing material; and
so on, till we blinded ourselves to the vulgar fact that we were,
all of us, people of very moderate means. Of course, then, we did
not know what to make of a man who could speak of poverty as if it
was not a disgrace. Yet, somehow, Captain Brown made himself
respected in Cranford, and was called upon, in spite of all
resolutions to the contrary.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_194a" id="Page_194a"></a>THE OPENING SCENE AT THE
TRIAL OF WARREN HASTINGS</h3>

<p class="center2">From "Essay on Warren Hastings"</p>

<p>On the 13th of February, 1788, the sittings of the Court
commenced. There have been spectacles more dazzling to the eye,
more gorgeous with jewelry and cloth of gold, more attractive to
grown-up children, than that which was then exhibited at
Westminster; but, perhaps, there never was a spectacle so well
calculated to strike a highly cultivated, a reflecting, an
imaginative mind. All the various kinds of interest which belong to
the near and to the distant, to the present and to the past, were
collected on one spot and in one hour. All the talents and all the
accomplishments which are developed by liberty and civilization
were now displayed with every advantage that could be derived both
from co-operation and from contrast. Every step in the proceedings
carried the mind either backward, through many troubled centuries,
to the days when the founda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195"
id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>tions of our constitution were
laid; or far away, over boundless seas and deserts, to dusky
nations living under strange stars, worshipping strange gods, and
writing strange characters from right to left. The High Court of
Parliament was to sit, according to forms handed down from the days
of the Plantagenets, on an Englishman accused of exercising tyranny
over the lord of the holy city of Benares and over the ladies of
the princely house of Oude.</p>

<p>The place was worthy of such a trial. It was the great hall of
William Rufus, the hall which had resounded with acclamations at
the inauguration of thirty kings, the hall which had witnessed the
just sentence of Bacon and the just absolution of Somers, the hall
where the eloquence of Strafford had for a moment awed and melted a
victorious party inflamed with just resentment, the hall where
Charles had confronted the High Court of Justice with the placid
courage which has half redeemed his fame.</p>

<p>Neither military nor civil pomp was wanting. The avenues were
lined with grenadiers. The streets were kept clear by cavalry. The
peers, robed in gold and ermine, were marshalled by the heralds
under Garter King-at-Arms. The judges in their vestments of state
attended to give advice on points of law. Near a hundred and
seventy lords, three fourths of the Upper House as the Upper House
then was, walked in solemn order from their usual place of
assembling to the tribunal. The junior Baron present led the way,
George Eliott, Lord Heathfield, recently ennobled for his memorable
defence of Gibraltar against the fleets and armies of France and
Spain. The long procession was closed by the Duke of Norfolk, Earl
Marshal of the realm, by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196"
id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>the great dignitaries, and by the
brothers and sons of the King. Last of all came the Prince of
Wales, conspicuous by his fine person and noble bearing.</p>

<p>The gray old walls were hung with scarlet. The long galleries
were crowded by an audience such as has rarely excited the fears or
the emulation of an orator. There were gathered together, from all
parts of a great, free, enlightened and prosperous empire, grace
and female loveliness, wit and learning, the representatives of
every science and of every art. There were seated round the Queen,
the fair-haired young daughters of the house of Brunswick. There
the Ambassadors of great Kings and Commonwealths gazed with
admiration on a spectacle which no other country in the world could
present. There Siddons, in the prime of her majestic beauty, looked
with emotion on a scene surpassing all the imitations of the stage.
There the historian of the Roman Empire thought of the days when
Cicero pleaded the cause of Sicily against Verres, and when, before
a senate which still retained some show of freedom, Tacitus
thundered against the oppressor of Africa.</p>

<p>There were seen, side by side, the greatest painter and the
greatest scholar of the age. The spectacle had allured Reynolds
from that easel which has preserved to us the thoughtful foreheads
of so many writers and statesmen, and the sweet smiles of so many
noble matrons. It had induced Parr to suspend his labours in that
dark and profound mine from which he had extracted a vast treasure
of erudition&mdash;a treasure too often buried in the earth, too
often paraded with injudicious and inelegant ostentation; but still
precious, massive, and splendid. There appeared the voluptuous
charms of her to whom the heir of the throne had in <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg
197]</a></span>secret plighted his faith. There too was she, the
beautiful mother of a beautiful race, the Saint Cecilia, whose
delicate features, lighted up by love and music, art has rescued
from the common decay. There were the members of that brilliant
society which quoted, criticised, and exchanged repartees under the
rich peacock hangings of Mrs. Montague. And there the ladies, whose
lips, more persuasive than those of Fox himself, had carried the
Westminster election against palace and treasury, shone round
Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire.</p>

<p>The Serjeants made proclamation. Hastings advanced to the bar
and bent his knee. The culprit was indeed not unworthy of that
great presence. He had ruled an extensive and populous country, had
made laws and treaties, had sent forth armies, had set up and
pulled down princes. And in his high place he had so borne himself
that all had feared him, that most had loved him, and that hatred
itself could deny him no title to glory except virtue. He looked
like a great man and not like a bad man. A person small and
emaciated, yet deriving dignity from a carriage which, while it
indicated deference to the court, indicated also habitual
self-possession and self-respect; a high and intellectual forehead;
a brow pensive, but not gloomy; a mouth of inflexible decision; a
face pale and worn, but serene, on which was written, as legibly as
under the picture in the council-chamber at Calcutta, <i>Mens aequa
in arduis</i>; such was the aspect with which the great Proconsul
presented himself to his judges.</p>

<p>His counsel accompanied him, men all of whom were afterwards
raised by their talents and learning to the highest posts in their
profession&mdash;the bold and strong-<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>minded Law, afterwards
Chief-Justice of the King's Bench; the more humane and eloquent
Dallas, afterwards, Chief-Justice of the Common Pleas; and Plomer,
who, near twenty years later, successfully conducted in the same
high court the defence of Lord Melville, and subsequently became
Vice-chancellor and Master of the Rolls.</p>

<p>But neither the culprit nor his advocates attracted so much
notice as the accusers. In the midst of the blaze of red drapery, a
space had been fitted up with green benches and tables for the
Commons. The managers, with Burke at their head, appeared in full
dress. The collectors of gossip did not fail to remark that even
Fox, generally so regardless of his appearance, had paid to the
illustrious tribunal the compliment of wearing a bag and sword.
Pitt had refused to be one of the conductors of the impeachment;
and his commanding, copious, and sonorous eloquence was wanting to
that great muster of various talents. Age and blindness had
unfitted Lord North for the duties of a public prosecutor; and his
friends were left without the help of his excellent sense, his
tact, and his urbanity.</p>

<p>But in spite of the absence of these two distinguished members
of the Lower House, the box in which the managers stood contained
an array of speakers such as perhaps had not appeared together
since the great age of Athenian eloquence. There were Fox and
Sheridan, the English Demosthenes and the English Hyperides. There
was Burke, ignorant, indeed, or negligent of the art of adapting
his reasonings and his style to the capacity and taste of his
hearers, but in amplitude of comprehension and richness of
imagination superior to every orator, ancient or modern.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg
199]</a></span></p>

<p>There, with eyes reverentially fixed on Burke, appeared the
finest gentleman of the age&mdash;his form developed by every manly
exercise, his face beaming with intelligence and spirit&mdash;the
ingenious, the chivalrous, the high-souled Windham. Nor, though
surrounded by such men, did the youngest manager pass unnoticed. At
an age when most of those who distinguish themselves in life are
still contending for prizes and fellowships at college, he had won
for himself a conspicuous place in Parliament. No advantage of
fortune or connection was wanting that could set off to the height
his splendid talents and his unblemished honour. At twenty-three he
had been thought worthy to be ranked with the veteran statesmen who
appeared as the delegates of the British Commons at the bar of the
British nobility. All who stood at the bar, save him alone, are
gone&mdash;culprit, advocates, accusers. To the generation which is
now in the vigour of life, he is the sole representative of a great
age which has passed away. But those who, within the last ten
years, have listened with delight till the morning sun shone on the
tapestries of the House of Lords, to the lofty and animated
eloquence of Charles, Earl Grey, are able to form some estimate of
the powers of a race of men among whom he was not the foremost.</p>

<p>The charges, and the answers of Hastings, were first read. The
ceremony occupied two whole days, and was rendered less tedious
than it would otherwise have been by the silver voice and just
emphasis of Cowper, the clerk of the court, near relation of the
amiable poet. On the third day Burke rose. Four sittings were
occupied by his opening speech, which was intended to be a general
introduction to all the charges. With an exuberance of <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg
200]</a></span>thought and splendour of diction which more than
satisfied the highly raised expectations of the audience, he
described the character and institutions of the natives of India;
recounted the circumstances in which the Asiatic empire of Britain
had originated; and set forth the constitution of the Company and
of the English Presidencies. Having thus attempted to communicate
to his hearers an idea of Eastern society, as vivid as that which
existed in his own mind, he proceeded to arraign the administration
of Hastings, as systematically conducted in defiance of morality
and public law.</p>

<p>The energy and pathos of the great orator extorted expressions
of unwonted admiration from the stern and hostile Chancellor, and,
for a moment, seemed to pierce even the resolute heart of the
defendant. The ladies in the galleries, unaccustomed to such
displays of eloquence, excited by the solemnity of the occasion,
and perhaps not unwilling to display their taste and sensibility,
were in a state of uncontrollable emotion. Handkerchiefs were
pulled out, smelling-bottles were handed round; hysterical sobs and
screams were heard; and Mrs. Sheridan was carried out in a fit. At
length the orator concluded. Raising his voice till the old arches
of Irish oak resounded: "Therefore," said he, "hath it with all
confidence been ordered by the Commons of Great Britain, that I
impeach Warren Hastings of high crimes and misdemeanours. I impeach
him in the name of the Commons' House of Parliament, whose trust he
has betrayed. I impeach him in the name of the English nation,
whose ancient honour he has sullied. I impeach him in the name of
the people of India, whose rights he has trodden under foot and
whose country he has turned into a desert. Lastly in the name of
human <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg
201]</a></span>nature itself, in the name of both sexes, in the
name of every age, in the name of every rank, I impeach the common
enemy and oppressor of all."</p>

<h3><a name="Page_201a" id="Page_201a"></a>PERORATION OF OPENING
SPEECH AGAINST WARREN HASTINGS</h3>

<p>1. In the name of the Commons of England, I charge all this
villainy upon Warren Hastings, in this last moment of my
application to you.</p>

<p>2. My Lords, what is it that we want here to a great act of
national justice. Do we want a cause, my Lords? You have the cause
of oppressed princes, of undone women of the first rank, of
desolated provinces, and of wasted kingdoms.</p>

<p>3. Do you want a criminal, my Lords? When was there so much
iniquity ever laid to the charge of any one? No, my Lords, you must
not look to punish any other such delinquent from India. Warren
Hastings has not left substance enough in India to nourish such
another delinquent.</p>

<p>4. My Lords, is it a prosecutor you want? You have before you
the Commons of Great Britain as prosecutors; and I believe, my
Lords, that the sun, in his beneficent progress round the world,
does not behold a more glorious sight than that of men, separated
from a remote people by the material bounds and barriers of nature,
united by the bond of a social and moral community&mdash;all the
Commons of England resenting, as <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>their own, the
indignities and cruelties that are offered to all the people of
India.</p>

<p>5. Do we want a tribunal? My Lords, no example of antiquity,
nothing in the modern world, nothing in the range of human
imagination, can supply us with a tribunal like this. My Lords,
here we see virtually, in the mind's eye, that sacred majesty of
the Crown, under whose authority you sit and whose power you
exercise. We have here all the branches of the royal family, in a
situation between majesty and subjection, between the sovereign and
the subject&mdash;offering a pledge in that situation, for the
support of the rights of the Crown and the liberties of the people,
both which extremities they touch.</p>

<p>6. My Lords, we have a great hereditary peerage here; those who
have their own honour, the honour of their ancestors, and of their
posterity, to guard, and who will justify, as they always have
justified, that precision in the Constitution by which justice is
made an hereditary office. My Lords, we have here a new nobility,
who have risen and exalted themselves by various merits, by great
civil and military services, which have extended the fame of this
country from the rising to the setting sun. My Lords, you have
here, also, the lights of our religion; you have the bishops of
England. My Lords, you have that true image of the primitive church
in its ancient form, in its ancient ordinances, purified from the
superstitions and vices which a long succession of ages will bring
upon the best institutions.</p>

<p>7. My Lords, these are the securities which we have in all the
constituent parts of the body of this House. We know them, we
reckon, we rest upon them, and commit safely the interests of India
and of humanity <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id=
"Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>into your hands. Therefore, it is
with confidence that, ordered by the Commons, I impeach Warren
Hastings, Esquire, of high crimes and misdemeanours. I impeach him
in the name of the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament
assembled, whose parliamentary trust he has betrayed. I impeach him
in the name of all the Commons of Great Britain, whose national
character he has dishonoured. I impeach him in the name of the
people of India, whose laws, rights, and liberties he has
subverted, whose property he has destroyed, whose country he has
laid waste and desolate. I impeach him in the name and by virtue of
those eternal laws of justice which he has violated. I impeach him
in the name of human nature itself, which he has cruelly outraged,
injured and oppressed, in both sexes, in every age, rank,
situation, and condition of life.</p>

<h3>ON THE DEATH OF KING EDWARD VII</h3>

<p class="center2">Delivered in the British House of Commons, May
12th, 1910</p>

<p>The late King, who has been suddenly taken away from us, had, at
the time of his death, not yet completed the tenth year of his
reign. Those years were crowded with moving and stirring events,
both abroad, in the Empire, and here at home. In our relations with
foreign countries they have been years of growing friendships, of
new understandings, of stronger and surer safeguards for the peace
of mankind. Within the Empire during the same time the sense of
interdependence, the consciousness of common interests and common
risks, the ever-tightening bonds of corporate unity have been
developed and vivified as they had never been before. Here at home,
as though it were by way of contrast, controversial issues of the
gravest kind&mdash;economic, social, and constitutional&mdash;have
ripened into a rapid maturity.</p>

<p>Sir, in all these multiform manifestations of our national and
imperial life, history will assign a part of singular dignity and
authority to the great Ruler whom we have lost. In external affairs
his powerful personal influence was steadily and zealously directed
to the avoidance not only of war, but of the causes and pretexts of
war, and he well earned the title by which he will always be
remembered, "the Peacemaker of the World."</p>

<p>Within the boundaries of his own Empire, by his intimate
knowledge of its component parts, by his broad <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>and
elastic sympathy not only with ambitions, and aspirations, but with
the sufferings and the hardships of his people, by his response to
any and every appeal whether to the sense of justice or the spirit
of compassion, he won a degree of loyalty, affection, and
confidence which few Sovereigns have ever enjoyed. At home, we all
recognize that, above the din and dust of our hard-fought
controversies, detached from party and attached only to the common
interests, we had in him an arbiter ripe in experience, judicial in
temper, at once a reverent worshipper of our traditions and a
watchful guardian of our constitutional liberties.</p>

<p>One is tempted, indeed constrained, on such an occasion as this
to ask what were the qualities which enabled a man called
comparatively late in life to new duties of unexampled
complexity&mdash;what were the qualities which in practice proved
him so admirably fitted to the task, and have given him an enduring
and illustrious record among the rulers and governors of the
nations? I should be disposed to assign the first place to what
sounds a commonplace&mdash;but in its persistent and unfailing
exercise is one of the rarest of virtues&mdash;his strong, abiding,
dominating sense of public duty.</p>

<p>King Edward, be it remembered, was a man of many and varied
interests. He was a sportsman in the best sense, an ardent and
discriminating patron of the Arts, and as well equipped as any man
of his time for the give-and-take of social intercourse; wholly
free from the prejudices and narrowing rules of caste; at home in
all companies; an enfranchised citizen of the world. To such a man,
endowed as he was by nature, placed where he was by fortune and by
circumstances, there <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id=
"Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>was open, if he had chosen to enter
it, an unlimited field for self-indulgence. But, Sir, as every one
will acknowledge who was brought into daily contact with him in the
sphere of affairs, his duty to the State always came first. In this
great business community there was no better man of business, no
man by whom the humdrum obligations&mdash;punctuality, method,
preciseness, and economy of time and speech&mdash;were more keenly
recognized or more severely practised. I speak with the privilege
of close experience when I say that wherever he was, whatever may
have been his apparent preoccupations, in the transactions of the
business of the State there were never any arrears, there was never
any trace of confusion, there was never any moment of avoidable
delay.</p>

<p>Next to these, Sir&mdash;I am still in the domain of practice
and administration&mdash;I should put his singular, perhaps an
unrivalled, tact in the management of men, and a judgment of
intuitive shrewdness as to the best outlet from perplexed and often
baffling situations. He had, in its highest and best development,
the genius of common sense. These rare gifts of practical
efficiency were, during the whole of his Kingship, yoked to the
service of a great ideal. He was animated every day of his
Sovereignty by the thought that he was at once the head and the
chief servant of that vast complex organism which we call the
British Empire. He recognized in the fullest degree both the powers
and the limitations of a Constitutional Monarch. Here, at home, he
was, though no politician, as every one knows, a keen Social
Reformer. He loved his people at home and over the seas. Their
interests were his interests; <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>their fame was his
fame. He had no self apart from them.</p>

<p>I will not touch for more than a moment on more delicate and
sacred ground&mdash;on his personal charm, the warmth and wealth of
his humanity; his unfailing considerateness for all who in any
capacity were permitted to work for him. I will only say, in this
connection that no man in our time has been more justly beloved by
his family and his friends, and no Ruler in our or in any time has
been more sincerely true, more unswervingly loyal, more uniformly
kind to his advisers and his servants. By the unsearchable counsels
of the Disposer of Events he has been called suddenly, and without
warning, to his account. We are still dazed under the blow which
has befallen us. It is too soon, as yet, even to attempt to realize
its full meaning, but this, at least, we may say at once and with
full assurance, that he has left to his people a memory and an
example which they will never forget, a memory of great
opportunities greatly employed, and an example which the humblest
of his subjects may treasure and strive to follow, of simplicity,
courage, self-denial, tenacious devotion up to the last moment of
conscious life to work, to duty, and to service.</p>

<h3>THE HEROES OF MAGERSFONTEIN</h3>

<p class="center2">Dec. 11, 1899</p>

<p>1. During the night it was considered expedient that the
Highland Brigade, 4,000 strong, under General Wauchope, should get
close enough to the lines of the foe to make it possible to charge
the heights. At midnight the gallant but ill-fated men moved
cautiously through the darkness toward the kopje where the Boers
were most strongly intrenched. They were led by a guide who was
supposed to know every inch of the country, out into the darkness
of an African night.</p>

<p>2. So onward until three of the clock on the Monday. Then out of
the darkness a rifle rang sharp and clear, a herald of
disaster&mdash;a soldier had tripped in the dark over the hidden
wires laid down by the enemy. In a second, in the twinkling of an
eye, the searchlights of the Boers fell broad and clear as the
noonday sun on the ranks of the doomed Highlanders, though it left
the enemy concealed in the shadows of the frowning mass of hills
behind them. For one brief moment the Scots seemed paralysed by the
suddenness of their discovery, for they knew that they were huddled
together like sheep within fifty yards of the trenches of the
foes.</p>

<p>3. Then clear above the confusion rolled the voice of the
General: "Steady, men, steady!"&mdash;and like an echo to the
veterans out came the crash of nearly a thousand rifles not fifty
paces from them. The Highlanders reeled before the shock like trees
before the tempest; their best, their bravest, fell in that wild
hail of lead. General Wauchope was down, riddled with bullets; yet
gasping, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg
222]</a></span>dying, bleeding from every vein, the Highland chief
raised himself on his hands and knees and cheered his men forward.
Men and officers fell in heaps together.</p>

<p>4. The Black Watch charged, and the Gordons and the Seaforths,
with a yell that stirred the British camp below, rushed onward to
death or disaster. The accursed wires caught them around the legs
until they floundered like trapped wolves, and all the time the
rifles of the foe sang the song of death in their ears. They fell
back broken and beaten, leaving nearly 1,300 dead and wounded, just
where the broad breast of the grassy veldt melts into the embrace
of the rugged African hills; and an hour later, the dawning came of
the dreariest day that Scotland has known for a generation
past.</p>

<p>5. Of her officers, the flower of her chivalry, the pride of her
breeding, but few remained to tell the tale&mdash;a sad tale truly,
but one untinted with dishonour nor smirched with disgrace, for up
these heights under similar circumstances, even a brigade of devils
could scarce have hoped to pass. All that mortal man could do the
Scots did; they tried, they failed, they fell, and there is nothing
left us now but to revere their memory and give them a place of
honour in the pages of history.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>6. Three hundred yards to the rear of the little township of
Modder River, just as the sun was sinking in a blaze of African
splendour, on the evening of Tuesday, the 12th of December, a long
shallow grave lay exposed in the breast of the veldt. To the
westward, the broad river fringed with trees runs murmuringly; to
the eastward, the heights still held by the enemy, scowled
menacingly; north and south the veldt undulated peacefully; a few
paces to the northward of that grave, fifty <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>dead
Highlanders lay dressed as they had fallen on the field of battle:
they had followed their chief to the field, and they were to follow
him to the grave.</p>

<p>7. How grim and stern these men looked as they lay face upward
to the sky, with great hands clutched in the last agony, and brows
still knit with the stern lust of the strife in which they had
fallen. The plaids, dear to every Highland clan, were represented
there, and out of the distance came the sound of pipes. It was the
General coming to join his men. There, right under the eyes of the
enemy, moved with slow and solemn tread all that remained of the
Highland Brigade. In front of them walked the chaplain, with bared
head, dressed in his robes of office; then came the pipers with
their pipes, sixteen in all, and behind them, with arms reversed,
moved the Highlanders, dressed in all the regalia of their
regiments, and in the midst the dead General, borne by four of his
comrades. Out swelled the pipes to the strains of "The Flowers of
the Forest," now ringing proud and high until the soldier's head
went back in haughty defiance&mdash;and eyes flashed through tears
like sunlight on steel, now sinking to moaning wail like a woman
mourning for her first-born, until the proud heads drooped forward
till they rested on heaving chests, and tears rolled down the wan
and scarred faces, and the choking sobs broke through the solemn
rhythm of the march of death.</p>

<p>8. Right up to the grave they marched, then broke away in
companies, until the General lay in the shallow grave with a
Scottish square of armed men around him. Only the dead man's son
and a small remnant of his officers stood with the chaplain and the
pipers, while the solemn service of the church was spoken.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg
224]</a></span></p>

<p>9. Then once again the pipes pealed out, and "Lochaber No More"
cut through the stillness like a cry of pain until one could almost
hear the widow in her Highland home mourning for the soldier she
would welcome back no more.</p>

<p>10. Then, as if touched with the magic of one thought, the
soldiers turned their tear-damped eyes from the still form in the
shallow grave toward the height where Cronje, the Lion of Africa,
and his soldiers stood. Then every cheek flushed crimson, and
strong jaws set like steel, and the veins on the hands that clasped
the rifle handles swelled almost to bursting with the fervour of
the grip, and that look from those silent, armed men spoke more
eloquently than ever spoke the tongues of orators. For on each
frowning face the spirit of vengeance sat, and each sparkling eye
asked silently for blood.</p>

<p>11. At the head of the grave, at the point nearest the enemy,
the General was laid to sleep, his officers grouped around him,
while in line behind him, his soldiers were laid in a double row
wrapped in their blankets. No shots were fired over the dead men
resting so peacefully, only the salute was given, and then the men
marched campwards as the darkness of an African night rolled over
the far-stretching breadth of the veldt.</p>

believe: censure me in your wisdom; and awake your<br />
senses, that you may the better judge. If there be any<br />
in this assembly, any dear friend of C&aelig;sar's, to him I<br />
say, that Brutus' love to C&aelig;sar was no less than his.
If<br />
then that friend demand why Brutus rose against C&aelig;sar,<span
class='linenum2'>20</span><br />
this is my answer.&mdash;Not that I loved C&aelig;sar less, but
that<br />
I loved Rome more. Had you rather C&aelig;sar were living,<br />
and die all slaves, than that C&aelig;sar were dead, to live<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg
226]</a></span> all free men? As C&aelig;sar loved me, I weep for
him; as<br />
he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I<br />
honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I slew him.<br />
There is tears for his love; joy for his fortune; honour<br />
for his valour; and death for his ambition. Who is here<br />
so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak; for<br />
him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would<span class=
'linenum2'>30</span><br />
not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.<br />
Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If<br />
any, speak; for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> None, Brutus, none.</p>

<p><i>Bru.</i> Then none have I offended. I have done no more<br />
to C&aelig;sar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of<br />
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
extenuated,<br />
wherein he was worthy; nor his offences enforced,<br />
for which he suffered death.<span class='linenum2'>40</span><br />
</p>

<p>[<i>Enter Antony and others, with C&aelig;sar's body.</i>]<br />
</p>

<p>Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,<br />
though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the<br />
benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth; as<br />
which of you shall not? With this I depart,&mdash;that, as<br />
I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the<br />
same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country<br />
to need my death.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Live, Brutus, live! live!</p>

Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. [<i>Exit</i>]</p>

<p><i>1 Cit.</i> Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.</p>

<p><i>3 Cit.</i> Let him go up into the public chair;<br />
We'll hear him.&mdash;Noble Antony, go up.</p>

<p><i>Ant</i>. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.</p>

<p><i>4 Cit.</i> What does he say of Brutus?</p>

<p><i>3 Cit.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
says, for Brutus' sake,<span class='linenum2'>70</span><br />
He finds himself beholding to us all.</p>

<p><i>4 Cit.</i> 'T were best to speak no harm of Brutus here.</p>

<p><i>1 Cit.</i> This C&aelig;sar was a tyrant.</p>

Nay, that's certain:<br />

<p><i>Ant.</i> Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your

I come to bury C&aelig;sar, not to praise him.<span class=
'linenum2'>80</span><br />
The evil that men do lives after them;<br />
The good is oft interred with their bones;<br />
So let it be with C&aelig;sar. The noble Brutus<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg
228]</a></span> Hath told you, C&aelig;sar was ambitious:<br />
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br />
And grievously hath C&aelig;sar answer'd it.<br />
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,&mdash;<br />
For Brutus is an honourable man;<br />
So are they all, all honourable men.&mdash;<br />
Come I to speak in C&aelig;sar's funeral.<span class=
'linenum2'>90</span><br />
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:<br />
But Brutus says he was ambitious;<br />
And Brutus is an honourable man.<br />
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,<br />
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<br />
Did this in C&aelig;sar seem ambitious?<br />
When that the poor have cried, C&aelig;sar hath wept:<br />
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br />
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br />
And Brutus is an honourable man.<span class=
'linenum2'>100</span><br />
You all did see that on the Lupercal<br />
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br />
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?<br />
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br />
And, sure, he is an honourable man.<br />
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br />
But here I am to speak what I do know.<br />
You all did love him once, not without cause:<br />
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?<br />
O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,<span class=
'linenum2'>110</span><br />
And men have lost their reason!&mdash;Bear with me;<br />
My heart is in the coffin there with C&aelig;sar,<br />
And I must pause till it come back to me.</p>

<p><i>1 Cit.</i> Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</p>

<p><i>2 Cit.</i> If thou consider rightly of the matter,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg

C&aelig;sar has had great wrong.</p>

<p><i>3 Cit.</i> Has he, masters?<br />
I fear there will a worse come in his place.</p>

<p><i>4 Cit.</i> Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the<br />
crown;<br />
Therefore 't is certain he was not ambitious.<span class=
'linenum2'>120</span><br />
<br />
<i>1 Cit.</i> If it be found so, some will dear abide it.<br />
<br />
<i>2 Cit.</i> Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with
weeping.<br />
<br />
<i>3 Cit.</i> There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.<br />
<br />
<i>4 Cit.</i> Now mark him, he begins again to speak.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> But yesterday the word of C&aelig;sar might<br />
Have stood against the world: now lies he there,<br />
And none so poor to do him reverence.<br />
O masters! if I were dispos'd to stir<br />
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,<br />
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,<span class=
'linenum2'>130</span><br />
Who, you all know, are honourable men;<br />
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose<br />
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you,<br />
Than I will wrong such honourable men.<br />
But here's a parchment, with the seal of C&aelig;sar;<br />
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:<br />
Let but the commons hear this testament,&mdash;<br />
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,&mdash;<br />
And they would go and kiss dead C&aelig;sar's wounds,<br />
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood.<span class=
'linenum2'>140</span><br />
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,<br />
And, dying, mention it within their wills,<br />
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy<br />
Unto their issue.<br />
<br />
<i>4 Cit.</i> We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.<br />

You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;<br />

It will inflame you, it will make you mad:<br />
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;<br />

You shall read us the will,&mdash;C&aelig;sar's will.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?<br />
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.<br />
I fear I wrong the honourable men<br />

<br />

<br />

Then make a ring about the corpse of C&aelig;sar,<br />
And let me show you him that made the will.<br />
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?<br />
<br />
<i>All.</i> Come down.<br />
<br />

<br />

'T was on a summer's evening, in his tent,<br />
That day he overcame the Nervii:&mdash;<br />
Look! in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:<span class=

See, what a rent the envious Casca made:<br />
Through this, the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;<br />
And, as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,<br />
Mark how the blood of C&aelig;sar follow'd it,<br />
As rushing out of doors, to be resolv'd<br />
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;<br />
For Brutus, as you know, was C&aelig;sar's angel:<br />
Judge, O you gods, how dearly C&aelig;sar lov'd him!<br />
This was the most unkindest cut of all;<br />
For when the noble C&aelig;sar saw him stab,<span class=

Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,<br />
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;<br />
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,<br />
Even at the base of Pompey's statue,<br />
Which all the while ran blood, great C&aelig;sar fell.<br />
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!<br />
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,<br />
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.<br />
O, now you weep; and I perceive, you feel<br />
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.<span class=

I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:<br />
I am no orator, as Brutus is;<br />
But as you know me all, a plain blunt man,<br />

That gave me public leave to speak of him.<br />
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,<br />
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,<br />
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;<br />
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;<br />
Show you sweet C&aelig;sar's wounds, poor, poor dumb mouths,<span

And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,<br />
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony<br />

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">At Flores in the Azores Sir
Richard Grenville lay,</span> <span class="i0">And a pinnace, like
a flutter'd bird, came flying from far away:</span> <span class=

fifty-three!"</span> <span class="i0">Then sware Lord Thomas
Howard: "'Fore God I am no coward;</span> <span class="i0">But I

sick. I must fly, but follow quick.</span> <span class="i0">We are
six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?"</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: "I know you are
no coward;</span> <span class="i0">You fly them for a moment to
fight with them again.</span> <span class="i0">But I've ninety men

coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,</span> <span class="i0">To
these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain."</span><br />
<span class="i0">So Lord Howard past away with five ships of war
that day,</span> <span class="i0">Till he melted like a cloud in
the silent summer heaven;</span> <span class="i0">But Sir Richard
bore in hand all his sick men from the land<span class=

slow,</span> <span class="i0">Men of Bideford in Devon,</span>
<span class="i0">And we laid them on the ballast down below;</span>

left to Spain,<span class='linenum2'>20</span></span> <span class=

<span class="i0">He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and

us now,</span> <span class="i0">For to fight is but to die!</span>
<span class="i0">There'll be little of us left by the time this sun
be set."</span> <span class="i0">And Sir Richard said again: "We be
all good English men.</span> <span class="i0">Let us bang these
dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,<span class=

below;</span> <span class="i0">For half of their fleet to the right
and half to the left were seen,<span class=

struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,</span> <span class=
"i0">And himself he was wounded again in the side and the
head,</span> <span class="i0">And he said, "Fight on! fight
on!"</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the night went down, and the sun smiled out
far over the summer sea,<span class='linenum2'>70</span></span>
<span class="i0">And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round
us all in a ring;</span> <span class="i0">But they dar'd not touch
us again, for they fear'd that we still could sting,</span> <span
class="i0">So they watch'd what the end would be.</span> <span
class="i0">And we had not fought them in vain,</span> <span class=
"i0">But in perilous plight were we,<span class=
'linenum2'>75</span></span> <span class="i0">Seeing forty of our
poor hundred were slain,</span> <span class="i0">And half of the
rest of us maim'd for life</span> <span class="i0">In the crash of
the cannonades and the desperate strife;</span> <span class=
"i0">And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and
cold,</span> <span class="i0">And the pikes were all broken or
bent, and the powder was all of it spent;<span class=
'linenum2'>80</span></span> <span class="i0">And the masts and the
rigging were lying over the side;</span> <span class="i0">But Sir
Richard cried in his English pride,</span> <span class="i0">"We
have fought such a fight for a day and a night</span> <span class=
"i0">As may never be fought again!</span> <span class="i0">We have
won great glory, my men!<span class='linenum2'>85</span></span>
<span class="i0">And a day less or more</span> <span class="i0">At
sea or ashore,</span> <span class="i0">We die&mdash;does it matter
when?</span> <span class="i0">Sink me the ship, Master
Gunner&mdash;sink her, split her in twain!</span> <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of
Spain!"<span class='linenum2'>90</span></span><br />
<span class="i0">And the gunner said "Ay, ay," but the seamen made
reply:</span> <span class="i0">"We have children, we have
wives,</span> <span class="i0">And the Lord hath spared our
lives.</span> <span class="i0">We will make the Spaniard promise,
if we yield, to let us go;</span> <span class="i0">We shall live to
fight again and to strike another blow."<span class=
'linenum2'>90</span></span> <span class="i0">And the lion there lay
dying, and they yielded to the foe.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore
him then</span> <span class="i0">Where they laid him by the mast,
old Sir Richard caught at last,</span> <span class="i0">And they
praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;</span>
<span class="i0">But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:<span
class='linenum2'>100</span></span> <span class="i0">"I have fought
for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;</span> <span
class="i0">I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do:</span>
<span class="i0">With a joyful spirit I Sir Richard Grenville
die!"</span> <span class="i0">And he fell upon their decks, and he
died.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they stared at the dead that had been so
valiant and true,<span class='linenum2'>105</span></span> <span
class="i0">And had holden the power and glory of Spain so
cheap</span> <span class="i0">That he dared her with one little
ship and his English few;</span> <span class="i0">Was he devil or
man? He was devil for aught they knew,</span> <span class="i0">But
they sank his body with honour down into the deep,</span> <span
class="i0"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id=

mann'd the Revenge with a swarthier alien crew,<span class=
'linenum2'>110</span></span> <span class="i0">And away she sail'd
with her loss and long'd for her own;</span> <span class="i0">When
a wind from the lands they had ruin'd awoke from sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">And the water began to heave and the weather to
moan,</span> <span class="i0">And or ever that evening ended a
great gale blew,</span> <span class="i0">And a wave like the wave
that is raised by an earthquake grew,<span class=
'linenum2'>115</span></span> <span class="i0">Till it smote on
their hulls and their sails and their masts and their flags,</span>
<span class="i0">And the whole sea plunged and fell on the
shot-shatter'd navy of Spain,</span> <span class="i0">And the
little Revenge herself went down by the island crags</span> <span

<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">On the sea and at the Hogue,
sixteen hundred ninety-two,</span> <span class="i1">Did the English
fight the French,&mdash;woe to France!</span> <span class="i0">And
the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter through the blue,</span>
<span class="i0">Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of
sharks pursue,</span> <span class="i1">Came crowding ship on ship
to St. Malo on the Rance,<span class='linenum2'>5</span></span>
<span class="i0">With the English fleet in view.</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Twas the squadron that escaped, with the victor
in full chase;</span> <span class="i1">First and foremost of the
drove, in his great ship, Damfreville:</span> <span class=
"i0"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg

and small,</span> <span class="i2">Twenty-two good ships in
all;<span class='linenum2'>10</span></span> <span class="i0">And
they signalled to the place,</span> <span class="i0">"Help the
winners of a race!</span> <span class="i1">Get us guidance, give us
harbour, take us quick&mdash;or, quicker still,</span> <span class=
"i1">Here's the English can and will!"</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and
leapt on board;<span class='linenum2'>15</span></span> <span class=
"i1">"Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass?"
laughed they:</span> <span class="i0">"Rocks to starboard, rocks to
port, all the passage scarred and scored,</span> <span class=
"i0">Shall the <i>Formidable</i> here, with her twelve and eighty
guns,</span> <span class="i1">Think to make the river-mouth by the
single narrow way,</span> <span class="i0">Trust to enter where
'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons,<span class=
'linenum2'>20</span></span> <span class="i2">And with flow at full
beside?</span> <span class="i2">Now 'tis slackest ebb of
tide.</span> <span class="i1">Reach the mooring? Rather say,</span>
<span class="i0">While rock stands or water runs,</span> <span
class="i1">Not a ship will leave the bay!"<span class=
'linenum2'>25</span></span><br />
<span class="i0">Then was called a council straight.</span> <span
class="i0">Brief and bitter the debate:</span> <span class=
"i0">"Here's the English at our heels; would you have them take in
tow</span> <span class="i0">All that's left us of the fleet, linked
together stern and bow,</span> <span class="i0">For a prize to

<span class="i1">"Let the captains all and each</span> <span class=

beach!<span class='linenum2'>35</span></span><br />
<span class="i0">Give the word!" But no such word</span> <span

<span class="i0">A Captain? a Lieutenant? a Mate&mdash;first,

Croisickese.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, "What mockery or malice have we here?" cries

my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell</span> <span

Sirs, believe me there's a way!<span class=

<span class="i0">Not a minute more to wait.</span> <span class=

by God's grace!</span> <span class="i0">See the noble fellow's
face</span> <span class="i0">As the big ship, with a bound,</span>
<span class="i0">Clears the entry like a hound.</span> <span class=
"i0">Keeps the passage, as its inch of way were the wide sea's
profound!<span class='linenum2'>75</span></span> <span class=
"i1">See, safe through shoal and rock,</span> <span class="i1">How
they follow in a flock,</span> <span class="i0">Not a ship that

<span class="i0">So, the storm subsides to calm:</span> <span

o'erlooking Gr&egrave;ve.</span> <span class="i0">Hearts that bled
are stanched with balm.</span> <span class="i0">"Just our rapture

bay,</span> <span class="i0">Gnash their teeth and glare
askance<span class='linenum2'>90</span></span> <span class="i1">As
they cannonade away!</span> <span class="i0">'Neath rampired

'linenum2'>95</span></span> <span class="i1">Let France, let
France's King,</span> <span class="i1">Thank the man that did the

class="i0">As he stepped in front once more,<span class=

surprise</span> <span class="i1">In the frank, blue Breton
eyes,</span> <span class="i0">Just the same man as
before.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then said Damfreville, "My friend,</span> <span
class="i0">I must speak out at the end,<span class=

<span class="i0">Then a beam of fun outbroke</span> <span class=

<h3><a name="Page_248a" id="Page_248a"></a>THE HANDWRITING ON THE
WALL</h3>

<p class="center2">Daniel <span class="smcap">V</span></p>

<p>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his
lords, and drank wine before the thousand. Belshazzar, whiles he
tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels
which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which
was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and
his concubines, might drink therein. Then they brought the golden
vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which
was in Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his
concubines, drank in them. They drank wine, and praised the gods of
gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</p>

<p>In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote
over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the
king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled
him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees

in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the
king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall
read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be
clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and
shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. Then came in all the
king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make
known to the king the interpretation thereof. Then was the king
Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in
him, and his lords were astonied.</p>

<p>Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords
came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king,
live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy
countenance be changed: There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is
the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light
and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was
found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I
say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers,
Chaldeans, and soothsayers; Forasmuch as an excellent spirit and
knowledge and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of
hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same
Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called,
and he will shew the interpretation.</p>

<p>Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake
and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the
children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought
out of Jewry? I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the
gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg
250]</a></span>wisdom is found in thee. And now the wise men, the
astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read
this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof:
but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing: And I have
heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve
doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me
the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and
have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler
in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be
to thyself, and give thy reward to another; yet I will read the
writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. O
thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a
kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: And for the majesty
that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and
feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept
alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.
But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,
he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from
him: And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made
like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed
him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of
heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of
men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will. And thou,
his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou
knewest all this; But has lifted up thyself against the Lord of
heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee,
and thou, and thy lords, thy <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>wives, and thy
concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods
of silver, of gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not,
nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and
whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified: Then was the part
of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.</p>

<p>And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath
numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art weighed in
the balances, and art found wanting. PERES; Thy kingdom is divided,
and given to the Medes and Persians. Then commanded Belshazzar, and
they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his
neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the
third ruler in the kingdom.</p>

<p>In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and
two years old.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_251a" id="Page_251a"></a>PAUL'S DEFENCE BEFORE
KING AGRIPPA</h3>

<p class="center2">Acts xxvi</p>

<p>1. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for
himself: I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because I shall answer
for myself this <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id=
"Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>day before thee touching all the
things whereof I am accused of the Jews: especially because I know
thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the
Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</p>

<p>2. My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; which knew me from
the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest
sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. And now I stand and am
judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and
night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, King Agrippa, I am
accused of the Jews.</p>

<p>3. Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that
God should raise the dead? I verily thought with myself, that I
ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I
shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief
priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against
them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled
them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I
persecuted them even unto strange cities.</p>

<p>4. Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
from the chief priests, at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light
from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about
me and them which journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to
the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the
Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for
thee to kick against the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253"
id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>pricks. And I said, Who art thou,
Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. But rise, and
stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this
purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things
which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will
appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the
Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to
turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto
God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance
among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</p>

<p>5. Whereupon, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
heavenly vision: but shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at
Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Jud&aelig;a, and then
to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do
works meet for repentance. For these causes the Jews caught me in
the temple, and went about to kill me. Having therefore obtained
help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and
great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and
Moses did say should come: that Christ should suffer, and that he
should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew
light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</p>

<p>6. And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud
voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee
mad. But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
the words of truth and soberness. For the king knoweth of these
things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that
none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not
done in a corner. King Agrippa, believ<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>est thou the
prophets? I know that thou believest. Then Agrippa said unto Paul,
Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. And Paul said, I would
to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day,
were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these
bonds.</p>

<p>7. And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the
governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: And when they
were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man
doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. Then said Agrippa unto
Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not
appealed unto C&aelig;sar.</p>

<span class="i0">An hundred men, the king did heare say,</span>
<span class="i0">The abbot kept in his house every day;</span>
<span class="i0">And fifty golde chaynes, without any doubt,</span>
<span class="i0">In velvet coates waited the abbot
about.</span><br />
<span class="i0">"How now, father abbot, I heare it of thee,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou keepest a farre better house than mee,</span>
<span class="i0">And for thy house-keeping and high renowne,</span>

my owne;</span> <span class="i0">And I trust, your grace will doe
me no deere,</span> <span class="i0">For spending of my owne
true-gotten geere."</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Yes, yes, father abbot, thy fault it is
highe,</span> <span class="i0">And now for the same thou needest
must dye;</span> <span class="i0">For except thou canst answer me
questions three,</span> <span class="i0">Thy head shall be smitten
from thy bodie.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And first," quo' the king, "when I'm in this

my head,</span> <span class="i0">Among all my liege-men so noble of
birthe,</span> <span class="i0">Thou must tell me to one penny what
I am worthe.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Secondlye, tell me, without any doubt,</span>
<span class="i0">How soone I may ride the whole world about.</span>
<span class="i0">And at the third question thou must not
shrink,</span> <span class="i0">But tell me here truly what do I
think."</span><br />
<span class="i0">"O, these are hard questions for my shallow
witt,</span> <span class="i0">Nor I cannot answer your grace as
yet:</span> <span class="i0">But if you will give me but three
weekes space,</span> <span class="i0">Ile do my endeavour to answer

<span class="i0">Away rode the abbot all sad at that word,</span>

mett his shepheard a going to fold:</span> <span class="i0">"How
now, my lord abbot, you are welcome home;</span> <span class=
"i0">What newes do you bring us from good king John?"</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Sad newes, sad newes, shepheard, I must
give;</span> <span class="i0">That I have but three days more to
live:</span> <span class="i0">For if I do not answer him questions
three,</span> <span class="i0">My head will be smitten from my

of birth,</span> <span class="i0">To within one penny of what he is
worth.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The seconde, to tell him, without any

must not shrinke,</span> <span class="i0">But tell him there truly

<span class="i0">"Now cheare up, sire abbot, did you never hear

<span class="i0">The king he laughed, and swore by St.

<span class="i0">The king he laughed, and swore by St. Jone,</span>

<h3><a name="Page_266a" id="Page_266a"></a>THE KEY TO HUMAN
HAPPINESS</h3>

<p class="center2">From "The Mill on the Floss"</p>

<p>1. At last Maggie's eyes glanced down on the books that lay on
the window-shelf, and she half forsook her reverie to turn over
listlessly the leaves of the "Portrait Gallery"; but she soon
pushed this aside to examine the little row of books tied together
with, string. "Beauties <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267"
id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>of the Spectator", "Rasselas",
"Economy of Human Life", "Gregory's Letters",&mdash;she knew the
sort of matter that was inside all these; the "Christian
Year"&mdash;that seemed to be a hymn-book, and she laid it down
again; but "Thomas &agrave; Kempis"&mdash;the name had come across
her in her reading, and she felt the satisfaction, which every one
knows, of getting some ideas to attach to a name that strays
solitary in the memory. She took up the little, old, clumsy book
with some curiosity; it had the corners turned down in many places,
and some hand, now for ever quiet, had made at certain passages
strong pen-and-ink marks, long since browned by time. Maggie turned
from leaf to leaf, and read where the quiet hand pointed ... "Know
that the love of thyself doth hurt thee more than anything in the
world.... If thou seekest this or that, and would'st be here or
there to enjoy thy own will and pleasure, thou shalt never be quiet
nor free from care; for in everything somewhat will be wanting, and
in every place there will be some that will cross thee.... Both
above and below, which way soever thou dost turn thee, everywhere
thou shalt find the Cross; and everywhere of necessity thou must
have patience, if thou wilt have inward peace, and enjoy an
everlasting crown.... It is but little thou sufferest in comparison
of them that have suffered so much, were so strongly tempted, so
grievously afflicted, so many ways tried and exercised. Thou
oughtest therefore to call to mind the more heavy sufferings of
others, that thou mayest the easier bear thy little adversities.
And if they seem not little unto thee, beware lest thy impatience
be the cause thereof.... Blessed are those ears that receive the
whispers of the divine voice, and listen not to the whisperings of
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg
268]</a></span>world. Blessed are those ears which hearken not unto
the voice which soundeth outwardly, but unto the Truth which
teacheth inwardly...."</p>

<p>2. A strange thrill of awe passed through Maggie while she read,
as if she had been awakened in the night by a strain of solemn
music, telling of beings whose souls had been astir while hers was
in stupor. She went on from one brown mark to another, where the
quiet hand seemed to point, hardly conscious that she was
reading&mdash;seeming rather to listen while a low voice
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>3. "Why dost thou here gaze about, since this is not the place
of thy rest? In heaven ought to be thy dwelling, and all earthly
things are to be looked on as they forward thy journey thither. All
things pass away, and thou together with them. Beware thou cleave
not unto them, lest thou be entangled and perish.... If a man
should give all his substance yet it is as nothing. And, if he
should do great penances, yet they are but little. And if he should
attain to all knowledge, he is yet far off. And if he should be of
great virtue, and very fervent devotion, yet is there much
wanting&mdash;to wit, one thing, which is most necessary for him.
What is that? That having left all, he leave himself, and go wholly
out of himself, and retain nothing of self-love.... I have often
said unto thee, and now again I say the same: Forsake thyself,
resign thyself, and thou shalt enjoy much inward peace.... Then
shall all vain imaginations, evil perturbations, and superfluous
cares fly away; then shall immoderate fear leave thee, and
inordinate love shall die."</p>

<p>4. Maggie drew a long breath and pushed her heavy hair back as
if to see a sudden vision more clearly. Here, then, was a secret of
life that would enable her to <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>renounce all other
secrets; here was a sublime height to be reached without the help
of outward things; here was insight, and strength and conquest, to
be won by means entirely within her own soul, where a supreme
Teacher was waiting to be heard. It flashed through her, like the
suddenly apprehended solution of a problem, that all the miseries
of her young life had come from fixing her heart on her own
pleasure, as if that were the central necessity of the universe;
and for the first time she saw the possibility of shifting the
position from which she looked at the gratification of her own
desires, of taking her stand out of herself, and looking at her own
life as an insignificant part of a divinely-guided whole. She read
on and on in the old book, devouring eagerly the dialogues with the
invisible Teacher, the pattern of sorrow, the source of all
strength, returning to it after she had been called away, and
reading till the sun went down behind the willows. With all the
hurry of an imagination that could never rest in the present, she
sat in the deepening twilight forming plans of self-humiliation and
entire devotedness; and, in the ardour of first discovery,
renunciation seemed to her the entrance into that satisfaction
which she had so long been craving in vain. She had not
perceived&mdash;how could she until she had lived longer?&mdash;the
inmost truth of the old monk's outpourings, that renunciation
remains sorrow, though a sorrow borne willingly. Maggie was still
panting for happiness, and was in ecstasy because she had found the
key to it. She knew nothing of doctrines and systems&mdash;of
mysticism or quietism; but this voice out of the far-off Middle
Ages was the direct communication of a human soul's belief and
experience, and came to Maggie as an unquestioned message.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg
270]</a></span> 5. I suppose that is the reason why the small,
old-fashioned book, for which you need pay only sixpence at a
book-stall, works miracles to this day, turning bitter waters into
sweetness; while expensive sermons and treatises, newly issued,
leave all things as they were before. It was written down by a hand
that waited for the heart's prompting; it is the chronicle of a
solitary hidden anguish, struggle, trust, and triumph&mdash;not
written on velvet cushions to teach endurance to those who are
treading with bleeding feet on the stones. And so it remains to all
time a lasting record of human needs and human
consolations&mdash;the voice of a brother who, ages ago, felt and
suffered and renounced in the cloister, perhaps, with serge gown
and tonsured head, with much chanting and long fasts, and with a
fashion of speech different from ours, but under the same silent
far-off heavens, and with the same passionate desires, the same
strivings, the same failures, the same weariness.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_278a" id="Page_278a"></a>ON THE DEATH OF
GLADSTONE</h3>

<p class="center2">Delivered in the Canadian House of Commons, May
26, 1898</p>

<p>England has lost the most illustrious of her sons; but the loss
is not England's alone, nor is it confined to the great empire
which acknowledges England's suzerainty, nor even to the proud race
which can claim kinship with the people of England. The loss is the
loss of mankind. Mr. Gladstone gave his whole life to his country;
but the work which he did for his country, was conceived and
carried out, on principles of such high elevation, for purposes so
noble, and aims so lofty, that not his country alone, but the whole
of mankind, benefited by his work. It is no exaggeration to say
that he has raised the standard of civilization, and the world
to-day is undoubtedly better for both the precept and the example
of his life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg
279]</a></span></p>

<p>His death is mourned not only by England, the land of his birth,
not only by Scotland, the land of his ancestors, not only by
Ireland for whom he did so much, and attempted so much more; but
also by the people of the two Sicilies, for whose outraged rights
he once aroused the conscience of Europe, by the people of the
Ionian Islands, whose independence he secured, and by the people of
Bulgaria and the Danubian Provinces, in whose cause he enlisted the
sympathy of his own native country. Indeed, since the days of
Napoleon, no man has lived whose name has travelled so far and so
wide, over the surface of the earth; no man has lived whose name
alone so deeply moved the hearts of so many millions of men.
Whereas Napoleon impressed his tremendous personality upon peoples
far and near, by the strange fascination which the genius of war
has always exercised over the imagination of men in all lands and
in all ages, the name of Gladstone had come to be in the minds of
all civilized nations, the living incarnation of right against
might&mdash;the champion, the dauntless, tireless champion, of the
oppressed against the oppressor. It is, I believe, equally true to
say that he was the most marvellous mental organization which the
world has seen since Napoleon&mdash;certainly the most compact, the
most active and the most universal.</p>

<p>This last half century in which we live, has produced many able
and strong men who, in different walks of life, have attracted the
attention of the world at large; and of the men who have
illustrated this age, it seems to me that in the eyes of posterity
four will outlive and outshine all others&mdash;Cavour, Lincoln,
Bismarck, and Gladstone. If we look simply at the magnitude of the
results obtained, compared with the exiguity of the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg
280]</a></span>resources at command,&mdash;if we remember that out
of the small Kingdom of Sardinia grew united Italy, we must come to
the conclusion that Count Cavour was undoubtedly a statesman of
marvellous skill and prescience. Abraham Lincoln, unknown to fame
when he was elected to the presidency, exhibited a power for the
government of men which has scarcely been surpassed in any age. He
saved the American Union, he enfranchised the black race, and for
the task he had to perform he was endowed in some respects almost
miraculously. No man ever displayed a greater insight into the
motives, the complex motives, which shape the public opinion of a
free country, and he possessed almost to the degree of an instinct,
the supreme quality in a statesman of taking the right decision,
taking it at the right moment and expressing it in language of
incomparable felicity. Prince Bismarck was the embodiment of
resolute common sense, unflinching determination, relentless
strength, moving onward to his end, and crushing everything in his
way as unconcerned as fate itself. Mr. Gladstone undoubtedly
excelled every one of these men. He had in his person a combination
of varied powers of the human intellect, rarely to be found in one
single individual. He had the imaginative fancy, the poetic
conception of things, in which Count Cavour was deficient. He had
the aptitude for business, the financial ability which Lincoln
never exhibited. He had the lofty impulses, the generous
inspirations which Prince Bismarck always discarded, even if he did
not treat them with scorn. He was at once an orator, a statesman, a
poet, and a man of business. As an orator he stands certainly in
the very front rank of orators of his country or any country of his
age or any age. I remember when Louis Blanc was in <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg
281]</a></span>England, in the days of the Second Empire, he used
to write to the press of Paris, and in one of his letters to "Le
Temps" he stated that Mr. Gladstone would undoubtedly have been the
foremost orator of England, if it were not for the existence of Mr.
Bright. It may be admitted, and I think it is admitted generally,
that on some occasions Mr. Bright reached heights of grandeur and
pathos which even Mr. Gladstone did not attain. But Mr. Gladstone
had an ability, a vigour, a fluency which no man in his age or any
age ever rivalled or even approached. That is not all. To his
marvellous mental powers he added no less marvellous physical
gifts. He had the eye of a god, the voice of a silver bell; and the
very fire of his eye, the very music of his voice swept the hearts
of men even before they had been dazzled by the torrents of his
eloquence.</p>

<p>As a statesman, it was the good fortune of Mr. Gladstone that
his career was not associated with war. The reforms which he
effected, the triumphs which he achieved, were not won by the
supreme arbitrament of the sword. The reforms which he effected and
the triumphs which he achieved were the result of his power of
persuasion over his fellow-men. The reforms which he achieved in
many ways amounted to a revolution. They changed, in many
particulars, the face of the realm. After Sir Robert Peel had
adopted the great principle which eventually carried England from
protection to free trade, it was Mr. Gladstone who created the
financial system which has been admitted ever since by all students
of finance, as the secret of Great Britain's commercial success. He
enforced the extension of the suffrage to the masses of the nation,
and practically thereby made the government of monarchical England
as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg
282]</a></span>democratic as that of any republic. He
disestablished the Irish church, he introduced reform into the land
tenure and brought hope into the breasts of those tillers of the
soil in Ireland who had for so many generations laboured in
despair. And all this he did, not by force or violence, but simply
by the power of his eloquence and the strength of his
personality.</p>

<p>Great, however, as were the acts of the man, after all he was of
the human flesh, and for him, as for everybody else, there were
trivial and low duties to be performed. It is no exaggeration to
say that even in those low and trivial duties he was great. He
ennobled the common realities of life. His was above all things a
religious mind&mdash;essentially religious in the highest sense of
the term. And the religious sentiment which dominated his public
life and his speeches, that same sentiment, according to the
testimony of those who knew him best, also permeated all his
actions from the highest to the humblest. He was a man of strong
and pure affections, of long and lasting friendship, and to
describe the beauty of his domestic life, no words of praise can be
adequate. It was simply ideally beautiful, and in the later years
of his life, as touching as it was beautiful. May I be permitted,
without any impropriety, to recall that it was my privilege to
experience and to appreciate that courtesy, made up of dignity and
grace, which was famous all the world over, but of which no one
could have an appropriate opinion, unless he had been the recipient
of it. In a character so complex and diversified, one may ask what
was the dominant feature, what was the supreme quality, the one
characteristic which marked the nature of the man. Was it his
incomparable genius for finance? Was it his splendid oratorical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg
283]</a></span>powers? Was it his marvellous fecundity of mind? In
my estimation it was not any one of these qualities. Great as they
were, there was one still more marked, and if I have to give my own
impression, I would say that the one trait which was dominant in
his nature, which marked the man more distinctly than any other,
was his intense humanity, his paramount sense of right, his
abhorrence of injustice, wrong, and oppression wherever to be found
or in whatever shape they might show themselves. Injustice, wrong,
oppression acted upon him, as it were, mechanically, and aroused
every fibre of his being, and from that moment to the repairing of
the injustice, the undoing of the wrong, and the destruction of the
oppression, he gave his mind, his heart, his soul, his whole life
with an energy, with an intensity, with a vigour paralleled in no
man unless it be the first Napoleon. There are many evidences of
this in his life. When he was travelling in Southern Italy, as a
tourist, for pleasure and for the benefit of the health of his
family, he became aware of the abominable system which was there
prevailing under the name of Constitutional Government. He left
everything aside, even the object which had brought him to Italy,
and applied himself to investigate and to collect evidence, and
then denounced the abominable system in a trumpet blast of such
power that it shook to its very foundations the throne of King
Ferdinand and sent it tottering to its fall. Again, when he was
sent as High Commissioner to the Ionian Islands, the injustice of
keeping this Hellenic population separated from the rest of Greece,
separated from the kingdom to which they were adjacent, and toward
which all their aspirations were raised, struck his generous soul
with such force that he became practically their advocate, <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg
284]</a></span>and secured their independence. Again, when he had
withdrawn from public life, and when, in the language of Thiers,
under somewhat similar circumstances, he had returned to "ses
ch&egrave;res &eacute;tudes," the atrocities perpetrated by the
Turks on the people of Roumania brought him back to public life
with a vehemence, an impetuosity, and a torrent of fierce
indignation that swept everything before it. If this be, as I think
it is, the one distinctive feature of his character, it seems to
explain away what are called the inconsistencies of his life.
Inconsistencies there were none in his life. He had been brought up
in the most unbending school of Toryism. He became the most active
reformer of our times. But whilst he became the leader of the
Liberal party and an active reformer, it is only due to him to say
that in his complex mind there was a vast space for what is known
as conservatism. His mind was not only liberal but conservative as
well, and he clung to the affections of his youth until, in
questions of practical moment, he found them clashing with that
sense of right and abhorrence of injustice of which I have spoken.
But the moment he found his conservative affections clash with what
he thought right and just, he did not hesitate to abandon his
former convictions and go the whole length of the reforms demanded.
Thus he was always devotedly, filially, lovingly attached to the
Church of England. He loved it, as he often declared. He adhered to
it as an establishment in England, but the very reasons and
arguments which, in his mind, justified the establishment of the
Church in England, compelled him to a different course as far as
that church was concerned in Ireland. In England the Church was the
church of the majority, of almost the unanimity of the nation. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg
285]</a></span>Ireland it was the church of the minority, and,
therefore, he did not hesitate. His course was clear: he removed
the one church and maintained the other. So it was with Home Rule.
But coming to the subject of Home Rule, though there may be much to
say, perhaps this is neither the occasion nor the place to say it.
The Irish problem is dormant, not solved; but the policy proposed
by Mr. Gladstone for the solution of this question has provoked too
much bitterness, too deep division, even on the floor of this
House, to make it advisable to say anything about it on this
occasion.</p>

<p>I notice it, however, simply because it is the last and
everlasting monument of that high sense of justice which, above all
things, characterized him. When he became convinced that Home Rule
was the only method whereby the long-open wound could be healed, he
did not hesitate one moment, even though he were to sacrifice
friends, power, popularity. And he sacrificed friends, power,
popularity, in order to give that supreme measure of justice to a
long-suffering people. Whatever may be the views which men
entertain upon the policy of Home Rule, whether they favour that
policy or whether they oppose it, whether they believe in it or
whether they do not believe in it, every man, whether friend or foe
of that measure, must say that it was not only a bold, but it was a
noble thought, that of attempting to cure discontent in Ireland by
trusting to Irish honour and Irish generosity.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, he is no more. England is to-day in tears, but
fortunate is the nation which has produced such a man. His years
are over; but his work is not closed; his work is still going on.
The example which he gave to the world shall live for ever, and the
seed which he has <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id=
"Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>sown with such a copious hand shall
still germinate and bear fruit under the full light of heaven.</p>

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Cromwell,<br />
The king has gone beyond me: all my glories<br />

No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,<br />

For thine own future safety.<br />
<br />
<i>Crom.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my

Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego<br />
So good, so noble, and so true a master?<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg

The king shall have my service; but my prayers,<br />
For ever and for ever, shall be yours.<br />
<br />
<i>Wol.</i> Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear<br />
In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,<span class=
'linenum2'>80</span><br />
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.<br />
Let's dry our eyes; and thus far hear me, Cromwell:<br />
And&mdash;when I am forgotten, as I shall be,<br />
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention<br />
Of me more must be heard of&mdash;say, I taught thee,<span class=

Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,<br />
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,<br />
Found thee a way, out of his wrack, to rise in;<br />
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.<br />

Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:<br />
By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,<br />
The image of his Maker, hope to win by 't?<br />
Love thyself last; cherish those hearts that hate thee;<br />
Corruption wins not more than honesty.<span class=

Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,<br />
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:<br />

<h3><a name="Page_296a" id="Page_296a"></a>ADVANTAGES OF IMPERIAL
FEDERATION</h3>

<p class="center2">From an address delivered in Toronto, January
30th, 1891, under the auspices of the Imperial Federation
League</p>

<p>I now go on to mention another and greater advantage of Imperial
Federation than the one which we have just been considering; an
advantage too that is so connected with that of improved trade that
the two must be considered together. In fact, in my opinion, the
first is not likely to be obtained without the second. We cannot
expect Britain to concede preferential trade to us, on the ground
that we are part of the Empire, unless we are willing to share the
responsibilities of the Empire. I say then, secondly, that only by
some form of Imperial Federation can the independence of Canada be
preserved, with due regard to self-respect.</p>

<p>If this is true, if Imperial Federation can do this, and if it
can be done in no other way, then the necessity for Imperial
Federation is proved; for national independence is an advantage so
great that no price can be named that is too great to give in
payment. It is the same with a country as with a man. Independent
he must be, or he ceases to be a man. Burns advises his young
friend to "gather gear" in every honourable way, and what for?</p>

<div class="poem3">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Not for to hoard it in a
dyke,</span> <span class="i1">Not for a train attendant;</span>
<span class="i0">But for the glorious privilege</span> <span class=
"i1">Of being independent.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg
297]</a></span></p>

<p>And that which is the supreme dignity of manhood is even more
essential in the case of a nation.</p>

<p>What do we mean when we speak of the independence of the
country? We mean something beyond price, something that is the
indispensable condition of true manhood in any country, something
without which a country is poor in the present and a butt for the
world's scorn in the future. There are men, or things that look
like men, who say that as long as we put money in our purse,
nothing else counts. How that class of men must have laughed some
centuries ago at a fool called William Wallace! How clearly they
could point out that it was much better to be part of the richer
country to the south. When they heard of the fate of the patriot,
did they not serenely say: "We told you so?" Did they not in their
hearts envy the false Menteath the price he got for betraying the
man who acted as true sentiment bade? But, give it time, and the
judgment of the world is just. Even the blind can now see whether
the patriot or the so-called "practical man" did most for
Scotland's advantage. Now</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">At Wallace' name, what
Scottish blood</span> <span class="i0">But boils up in a springtime
flood!</span> <span class="i0">Oft have our fearless fathers
strode</span> <span class="i3">By Wallace' side,</span> <span
class="i0">Still pressing onward, red-wat shod,</span> <span class=
"i3">Or glorious died.</span></div>
</div>

<p>What has his memory been worth to Scotland! Would you estimate
it in millions? Superior persons will tell me that Wallace is an
anachronism. In form, yes; in spirit, never. It may be said that in
the end Scotland did unite with England. Yes, but first, what a
curse the union would have been if unaccompanied, as in the case of
Ireland, with national self-respect! And, secondly, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg
298]</a></span>Canada is ready for union with the States any day on
the same terms as those which Scotland got: (1) That the States
accept our Queen or King as their head. (2) That we keep our own
civil and criminal law and parliamentary constitution, as Scotland
did. (3) That the whole Empire be included in the arrangement, as
the whole of Scotland was in the union. Surely the men who are
never tired of citing the case of Scotland and England as parallel
to ours must admit that this is fair.</p>

<p>But, here comes a question that must be faced. Is it worth while
preserving the independence, the unity, and dignity of Canada?
There are men who, for one reason or another, doubt whether it is.
They have lost faith in the country, or rather they never had any
faith to lose. It is this absence of faith that is at the bottom of
all their arguments and all their unrest. Now, I do not wonder that
there should be men who do not share our faith. Men who were
brought up in England, and who have seen and tasted the best of it;
who are proud of that "dear, dear land", as Shakespeare called it,
proud of its history, its roll of saints, statesmen, heroes; of its
cathedrals, colleges, castles; of its present might as well as its
ancient renown; and who have then come to live in
Canada,&mdash;well, they naturally look with amused contempt at our
raw, rough ways, our homespun legislators and log colleges,
combined with lofty ambitions expressed sometimes&mdash;it must be
admitted&mdash;in bunkum. I do not wonder, either, that men who
have been citizens of the United States, who exult in its vast
population, its vast wealth, and its boundless energy, should think
it madness on our part that we are not knocking untiringly at their
door for admission, and that the only explanation of our attitude
that they can give is that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299"
id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>we are "swelled heads", or "the
rank and file of jingoism." But, after all, they must know that
this question is not to be settled by them. It must be settled by
genuine Canadians. We, like Cartier, are Canadians <i>avant
tout</i>. Most of us have been born in the land, have buried our
fathers and mothers, and some of us our children, too, in the natal
soil, and above the sacred dust we have pledged ourselves to be
true to their memories and to the country they loved, and to those
principles of honour that are eternal! God helping, we will do so,
whether strangers help or hinder! We do not think so meanly of our
country that we are willing to sell it for a mess of pottage. I
know Canada well, from ocean to ocean; from the rich sea pastures
on the Atlantic all the way across to Vancouver and Victoria. Every
province and every territory of it, I know well. I know the people,
too, a people thoroughly democratic and honest to the core. I would
now plainly warn those who think that there is no such thing as
Canadian sentiment that they are completely mistaken. They had
better not reckon without their host. The silent vote is that which
tells, and though it will not talk, it will vote solid all the time
for those who represent national sentiment when the national life
is threatened. I am not a party man. In my day, I have voted about
evenly on both sides, for when I do vote, it is after consideration
of the actual issues involved at the time. Both sides therefore
rightly consider me unreliable, but, perhaps, both will listen when
I point out that the independent vote is increasing, and that it is
the only vote worth cultivating. The true Grit or Tory will vote
with his party, right or wrong. No time, therefore, need be given
to him. Let the wise candidate win the men who believe that the
country is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id=
"Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>higher than party, and there is, I
think, only one thing that these men will not forgive&mdash;lack of
faith in the country. They have no doubt that it is worth while to
preserve the unity, dignity, and independence of Canada.</p>

<p>We are quite sure of this. Are we as sure that it is our duty to
pay the price? The United States are paying three or four times our
whole revenue in pensions to those who fought to keep the country
united. They do not grudge this enormous price. They have besides a
respectable army, and a fleet that will soon be formidable. What
means do we find it necessary to use? In any trouble we simply call
on the Mother Country. The present system is cheap. No! it is dear
and nasty, and cannot last.</p>

<p>What should we do? First, let us remember what Britain has dared
for us within the last two or three years. Britain would fight the
rest of the world rather than the United States,&mdash;not because
the Republic could hurt her seriously, not because her trade with
it is five times as much as with us, but because she is proud of
her own eldest child and knows that a war between mother and
daughter would be a blow struck at the world's heart. Yet, for us
she spoke the decisive word from which there was no drawing back.
For us, once and again, because we were in the right, she dared a
risk which she hated with her whole soul.</p>

<p>Let us show that we appreciate her attitude. Let us, at any
rate, do what Australia has done&mdash;enter into a treaty,
according to which we shall pay so much a year for a certain number
of ships, to be on our own coasts in peace, and in war at the
disposal of the Empire. That would be tantamount to saying: "You
have shared our risks, we will share yours; we will pay part of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg
301]</a></span>insurance that is necessary to guarantee peace; we
are educating officers for the army, and we are willing to give a
much needed addition to the fleet". That would be a first step
toward the attainment of full citizenship. What would be the next?
We could ask that our voice should be heard in some constitutional
way before any war was decided on. And we would have the right
standing ground from which to urge a wise system of preferential
trade in the common interest. These three things are, in my
opinion, connected, and I have ventured to indicate the order in
which they should be taken.</p>

<p>Would it pay? The experience of the world proves that nothing
pays in the long run but duty-doing. How can a country grow great
men if it is content to be in leading-strings, and to give
plausible excuses to show that that state of things is quite
satisfactory?</p>

<p>Only by some form of Imperial Federation can the unity of the
Empire be preserved.</p>

<p>The previous advantages to which I referred concerned Canada
directly. This one may appear, to some persons, far away from us,
but it is not. In another speech I may enlarge on this advantage,
but suffice it to say now, that we cannot isolate ourselves from
humanity. Canada ought to be dearer to us than any other part of
the Empire, but none the less we must admit that the Empire is more
important to the world than any of its parts, and every true man is
a citizen of the world.</p>

<p>I will not speak to-night of what the Empire has done for us in
the past, of the rich inheritance into which we have entered, and
of the shame that falls on children who value lightly the honour of
their family and race. Consider only the present position of
affairs. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id=
"Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>European nations are busy watching
each other. Britain is detaching herself from them, understanding
that she is an oceanic, colonizing, and world power, much more than
a European state. The United States and Britain are the two Powers,
one in essence, cradled in freedom, that have a great future before
them. According to the last census, the first has a population of
some fifty-four millions of whites. The census of next April will
show that the other has nearly forty millions in the home islands
and ten millions in the self-governing Colonies. The two Powers
have thus about the same population of white men, and the two are
likely to grow at the same rate.</p>

<p>In Britain the rate of increase will be less, but in the
Colonies it will be greater than in the States during the next half
century. The States will keep united. They have stamped out
disunion. We have to prove that we intend to keep the Empire
united; but that can be done only by giving the ten millions a
gradually increasing share in common privileges and
responsibilities. Surely such a work is not beyond the resources of
statesmanship. For a long time decentralization was needed. Now,
all the signs of the times indicate the necessity to centralize.
The days of small powers are over, and modern inventions make
communication easy between east and west, as well as between north
and south.</p>

<p>If this is not done, what will certainly happen? Separation,
first of one part then of another; weakness of each part and
weakness all round. Think of the impetus that this would give to
every force that makes for chaos among the three hundred millions
over whom God in His providence has placed us. The work that the
British Empire has in hand is far grander than the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg
303]</a></span>comparatively parochial duties with which the States
are content to deal. Its problems are wider and more inspiring;
yet, at the same time, the white race that alone, so far, has
proved itself fit for self-government, lives by itself, instead of
being commingled with a coloured race to which only nominal freedom
is allowed. Any one who has lived either in South Africa or in the
Southern States will understand what a free hand and what an
unspeakable leverage this gives us. We need no Force Bill to ensure
a free ballot in Britain, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand.
Already our sons are taking their part in introducing civilization
into Africa, under the aegis of the flag, and in preserving the
<i>Pax Britannica</i> among the teeming millions of India and
southeastern Asia, those peoples kindred to ourselves, who for
centuries before had been the prey of successive spoilers. Think of
the horizon that this opens up, and remember that in building a
state we must think not of the present but of the future.</p>

<p>In a generation all the best land on this continent will have
been taken up. But, thanks to the far-reaching wisdom of our
fathers, the greater part of the world will be open to the trade,
to the colonizing, and to the enterprise of our children. We shall
not be confined to a frozen north or to a single continent. We
shall take part in work that is of world-wide significance, and
shall act out our belief that God loves not North America only, but
the whole world. Only on conditions of the British Empire standing,
can this be done. This is the ideal that we should set before us,
and remember that no people has ever been a great or permanent
factor in the world that was without high ideals. I know that this
advantage to which I am referring is not one that can be <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg
304]</a></span>calculated in dollars, any more than the work of a
Wallace or the poems of a Shakespeare, the life of Sydney or the
death of Gordon; but it is an advantage none the less for which
many of us are content to struggle and, if need be, to suffer. What
are we in this world for? Surely for something higher than to still
the daily craving of appetite. Surely for something higher than to
accumulate money, though it should be to the extent of adding
million to million. Surely we are in the world for something
better! Yes, we are here to think great thoughts, to do great
things, to promote great ideals. This can be done only through
faithfulness to the best spirit of our fathers. Society is an
organism, and must preserve its continuity. It must work, too,
through instruments; and the most potent, keenest, best-tried
instrument on earth for preserving peace, order, liberty and
righteousness, is the Empire of which we are citizens. Shall we
throw away that citizenship, or shall we maintain and strengthen
that Empire?</p>

<h4>PHYSICAL EXERCISES</h4>

<p class="four_b">(<i>These exercises form a course by themselves
and should not be introduced into the regular reading
lesson.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breathing.</span>&mdash;The proper
management of the breath is of the greatest importance in speaking
and reading. Inhalation and exhalation should be gradual and
natural, not spasmodic. The reader should never allow his supply of
breath to be wholly exhausted, but should replenish it at regular
intervals. Inhalation should be through the nostrils, not the
mouth. This prevents gasping, and promotes and preserves a healthy
condition of the vocal organs. It is not necessary to keep the
mouth closed in order that the breath be inhaled through the
nostrils. Inhalation may be effected when the mouth is open by
allowing the tip of the tongue to touch the upper palate. All
breathing exercises should be deep, commencing with the abdomen,
and should expand the chest to the fullest capacity.</p>

<p><i>Exercise I.</i> Stand erect in a well ventilated room. Inhale
slowly from the abdomen while counting five, hold the breath while
counting five, and exhale while counting five.</p>

<p>Repeat this exercise, gradually increasing the count by one
until the maximum of ten or fifteen is reached.</p>

<p><i>Exercise II.</i> Practise the preceding exercise in the open
air while walking, taking five steps while inhaling, holding the
breath, and exhaling respectively. The count may be increased as in
the preceding.</p>

<p><i>Exercise III.</i> Stand erect, arms akimbo, fingers pressing
the abdominal muscles in front, thumbs on the dorsal muscles on
each side of the spine. Rise slowly on the toes while inhaling,
hold the breath while standing on tiptoe, and exhale while
gradually resuming the original position. In each case regulate the
count as in the preceding exercises.</p>

<p><i>Exercise IV.</i> Stand erect, arms hanging loosely at the
sides. Inhale slowly, rising on the toes, clenching the fists with
gradually increased intensity, and raising them to the arm-pits.
Expel the breath suddenly, dropping back to the original
position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chest and Lungs.</span>&mdash;Gymnastic
exercises, such as develop the chest and lungs, are of great
importance, since they regulate the breathing capacity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg
313]</a></span> <i>Exercise I.</i> Stand erect, arms hanging
loosely at the sides. Raise the arms slowly to the vertical
position over the head, making the hands meet with palms outward,
the thumb of the left hand over the right, rising on the toes at
the same time; then let the arms fall apart slowly to their
original position, while coming down on the heels.</p>

<p><i>Exercise II.</i> Stand erect as in the preceding. Bring the
arms slowly forward until the hands meet on a level with the mouth,
bending forward slightly and rising on the toes; then throw back
the arms in a circular movement, allowing them to fall to their
original position, coming down on the heels at the same time.</p>

<p><i>Exercise III.</i> Raise the hands above the head; bring down
the elbows to the sides; shoot out the hands in front; bring in the
elbows to the sides; shoot down the hands toward the floor; firing
up the elbows to the sides. Repeat. This exercise may be practised
with hands clenched.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Throat and Neck</span>.&mdash;Exercises of
the throat and neck develop and keep flexible the vocal cords,
which are of prime importance in producing pure tones.</p>

<p><i>Exercise I.</i> Stand erect. Look at the ceiling; allow the
head to drop backward as far as possible; then bring the head
slowly forward until the chin rests on the chest. Repeat.</p>

<p><i>Exercise II.</i> Stand erect. Twist the head slowly to the
left, without moving the shoulders, until the chin is parallel to
the left shoulder; then slowly twist the head to the right, without
moving the shoulders, until the chin is parallel to the right
shoulder. Repeat.</p>

<p><i>Exercise III.</i> Press the head to the left until the left
ear rests almost on the left shoulder, raising the right arm above
the head at the same time. Practise this exercise, pressing the
head to the right and raising the left arm. Repeat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouth</span>.&mdash;To produce the finest
tones of the voice, three conditions of the mouth are
necessary:</p>

<p>(1) The mouth must be well opened.<br />
(2) The vocal aperture must be large.<br />
(3) The jaws must be flexible.<br />
</p>

<p>If the mouth is well opened the tones are full; if partially
closed they are muffled. The vocal aperture is the opening in the
rear of the mouth produced by the elevation of the uvula, and <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg
314]</a></span>the depression of the root of the tongue and the
larynx. The purity and richness of the voice depend, to a great
extent, upon the capacity of the vocal aperture. If it is of small
capacity, or contracted, the tones are impure and nasal.</p>

<p>The mode of producing pure tones can be studied best before a
mirror placed so that the light falls upon the back part of the
mouth.</p>

<p><i>Exercise I.</i> Open the mouth to the fullest extent and
close rapidly. Repeat.</p>

<p><i>Exercise II.</i> Open the mouth to the fullest extent, so
that the uvula rises and almost disappears, and the root of the
tongue and larynx are depressed. The action is similar to yawning,
and to accomplish it "think a yawn", if necessary.</p>
